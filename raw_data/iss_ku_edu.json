In general you can expect these steps: Complete the Online Visa Application (DS-160) after you have received your I-20 or DS-2019 Schedule an Interview Gather Required Documentation Attend Your Visa Interview Find a US Embassy or Consulate Documents Needed to Apply for a F-1 Student or J-1 Exchange Visitor Visa In general, to apply you will need: Form I-20 (for F-1) or Form DS-2019 (for J-1) Passport Proof of financial support SEVIS fee receipt Photos Visa application fee Online visa application forms Check Visa for Accuracy Check your visa for accuracy (name, date of birth, visa type \u2013 such as F-1 or J-1), and request a correction immediately if you find any errors. Tips for a Successful Visa Interview The following are tips to help you succeed in your visa interview. Be honest, friendly, and have a good attitude. Be on time and prepared. Be prepared to do the interview in English. Keep your answers simple, and to the point. If asked, share information about your academic background and what you expect to get out of your education in the U.S. Be prepared to show strong ties to your home country. Organize your documentation so is can be presented without hesitation, if asked. Be prepared to show sufficient financial proof that a sum at least equal to the amount indicated on the I-20 is readily available. If you are married, and your family is remaining in your home country, be prepared to explain how they will support themselves in your absence. Mention any family member who has complete higher education in the U.S. who has now returned to your country. Be prepared to address a mandatory military service if your country has one. The following are things you should not do during the visa interview. Do not bring family, friends, electronics (including cellphones), glass, food, lighters, cigarettes, makeup, or belt buckles. Do not state that you intend to work in the U.S., even temporarily, after completing your studies. Please remember to show sufficient finances to support any dependents. If your visa is denied, politely request the reason for the denial in writing. Transit Visa If you are traveling through another country on your way to the United States you might need a transit visa from that country. Please check with that country\u2019s embassy or consulate office to determine if you are required to obtain a transit visa. J-1 Exchange Visitors Many J-1 Exchange Visitors become subject to the INA 212(e) two-year home country physical presence requirement. The consular officer makes a preliminary determination at the time of your interview if you will be subject to this requirement upon entering the U.S. in J-1 status. It should be marked on both your J-1 visa and your DS-2019. (Note: sometimes these initial determinations are incorrect.) You can learn more about why and if you are subject, and the specific limitations set forth by the two-year home residency requirement . Canadian Citizens Canadian citizens do not need a U.S. visa, but they must present a valid passport, proof of\u00a0finances, I-20 or DS-2019, and SEVIS fee receipt at the U.S. port of entry.

Also notify them you will be using your card in the U.S. ATM cards should be tied to a checking (not savings) account.

There are some airports outside the U.S. where you may go through this inspections process prior to your departure. Review the list of \"Preclearance\u00a0\u200bLocations\" before you travel. Important : make sure you enter before your arrival date . Documents to Present at the U.S. Port of Entry Click to expand Do not put your immigration documents in your checked luggage ! When you enter the U.S. you must bring all of your immigration documents with you, and keep them with you at all times when you travel. You will be required to go through the inspection before you will be allowed to collect your luggage. Carry the following documents with you to present to CBP: Passport (with at least 6 months of future validity) I-20 for F students, or DS-2019 for J students Valid visa SEVIS fee receipt (for F-1 and J-1 students) Proof of finances for your study in the U.S., including for the support of dependents who accompany you Letter of admission to the University of Kansas The CBP officer will examine all of your documents, and may ask you several questions about why you are traveling to the U.S. and how you plan to finance your stay. Politely and honestly answer the CBP officer\u2019s questions. The CBP officer will then decide if you will be admitted to the United States. Secondary Inspection Click to expand You may be sent to another area for a second inspection with a CBP officer. The CBP officer\u2019s decision to send a person to secondary inspection is sometimes random, or it may be because they decided they needed more time to look at your documents and perform additional inspections. It is important to remain calm and polite during the inspection process. Admission to the U.S. and your I-94 Click to expand Once the CBP officer has made the decision to admit you to the U.S., you will be photographed, fingerprinted and an admission stamp will be put in your passport. The stamp will indicate the status you are being given (F-1, J-1 etc). Your arrival will be registered electronically. Afterwards you can log into the CBP website to view and print a copy of your I-94, a document that verifies your legal entry. When you leave the inspection area, make sure you do not leave any of your documents behind! Once you have finished the inspection process, you will be able to claim your luggage and continue on your way.

Below is information about various companies currently connecting from the Kansas City airport to Lawrence: Flat Rate: flat rate means that this is the total cost of the shuttle reservation, regardless of whether or not it is used by only one passenger or more than one passenger. Shared Ride: shared ride means that you pay the specified amount to reserve your space in a shuttle that may also be providing transportation to other individuals. Better Alternative Transportation Services (BATS) 5 Guys Transportation Super Shuttle SDM Transportation Taxi Service Click to expand Taxis are available through various taxi service telephones located at the baggage claim areas in each terminal and outside the terminal exits.

Some of the campus student nationality organizations also assist students from their representative countries. Please take a look at the list of campus student organizations .

Instead of taxi cabs, Uber drivers go through an application process and background check to offer taxi-like services in their own cars. Prices vary depending on demand, but Uber is generally a cheaper option than taxis and tips are not currently expected.

Limitation on counting ONLINE course credits towards minimum requirement: Generally, only one online class (up to 3 credit hours) can count towards the full-time enrollment requirement. Note: students taking any AEC classes cannot count any online class towards the full-time enrollment requirement. A Reduced Course Load (RCL) is a permission from an ISS Advisor to enroll below the full-time requirements for a given semester.\u00a0 Federal regulations provide limited circumstances for when an F-1 student may be authorized for an RCL.\u00a0 These include medical reasons, academic reasons, and completion of studies during the final term.\u00a0 In some cases, a graduate student enrolled part-time may be considered pursuing a full course of study for immigration purposes. Each request requires review by an ISS advisor before it is approved; approval is granted on a semester basis. Important: Dropping below full time without ISS permission is a deportable offense. If KU ISS has not approved the RCL by the deadline or prior to dropping below full time, you will be considered in violation of your legal status. Reduce Course Load Eligibility Reasons Click to expand Medical In some cases, a student will need an RCL due to a temporary medical condition.\u00a0 Students will need to submit a letter on letterhead signed by an appropriate licensed medical doctor, psychiatrist, doctor of osteopathy, licensed psychologist, or clinical psychologist recommending the RCL for the specific semester. The following wording is suggested: As a \u201clicensed medical doctor\u201d (or psychiatrist, or doctor of osteopathy, or licensed psychologist, or clinical psychologist), I recommend \u201cStudent\u2019s full name and DOB\u201d reduce his/her course load (or withdraw from all classes) due to a temporary illness or medical condition for the \u201cappropriate semester.\u201d Approval for medical reasons must be obtained each semester requested.\u00a0 Approval cannot exceed an aggregate of 12 months per program level. Academic An RCL may also be granted in a situation where a student is experiencing academic difficulties.\u00a0 Approval of an academic RCL can be granted only once per program level (i.e. Bachelors, Masters, PhD), and a student must complete at least six credit hours in that semester . Permissible academic RCL reasons include: Initial difficulties with the English language (usually only 1st\u00a0semester) Initial difficulties with reading requirements (usually only 1st\u00a0semester) Unfamiliarity with U.S. teaching methods (usually only 1st\u00a0semester) Improper Course Level Placement (can apply if student is unprepared or in jeopardy of failing a course). Final Semester Students who need less than a full course load to complete degree requirements in their final semester may qualify for a final semester RCL.\u00a0\u00a0A final semester RCL is available even if a student has previously been authorized for a medical or academic RCL. Graduate Students with Part-Time Enrollment Graduate students who have finished everything except their dissertation, thesis, final project or equivalent may get permission to enroll part time. For example: Masters students who have completed all required lecture coursework and are solely completing their thesis or final project. Doctoral students who have completed all required lecture coursework and are solely completing their dissertation. Graduate students who are taking their final required lecture course(s) in the current term before starting a thesis, dissertation, or final project.

    "text": "On Campus Employment Overview On-campus employment is permitted \"incident to your status\" as an F-1 student. This means you are eligible as soon as you obtain F-1 status and this type of employment does not require an application to the federal government. On-campus work is defined as work that is done for, and paid by, the University of Kansas. Examples of common positions include teaching assistantships (GTA), research assistantships (GRA), and student hourly employment (KU Dining Services, Library, etc). Limitation on number of hours you may work You may work on-campus up to 20 hours per week during the academic year (fall and spring semester) when classes are in session, and unlimited hours during any recess periods, such as winter break or summer vacation. With the approval of the hiring department, students are allowed to work more than 20 hours per week starting on Stop Day and ending on the day before the First day of classes the next semester. If you begin your\u00a0program in the summer term, it is not considered a vacation period and you are restricted to 20 hours per week. On-campus employment is not permitted after completion of a degree program unless the student has been issued a Form I-20 to begin a new program at KU. On-campus employment is not deducted from other types of work The time you spend working on-campus is not deducted from the amount of time you are allowed to work, such as F-1 Optional Practical Training and does not need to be related to your field of study. You are not eligible for jobs classified as \"Work-Study\" This is because Work-Study jobs are subsidized by United States federal financial aid for American students. Where to look for on-campus jobs KU On-Campus Jobs Website KU Dining and Memorial Unions Job Website After you find an\u00a0On-Campus Job Apply for a Social Security Number (if you don't have one) You must apply in person to the Social Security Administration, a federal agency, for a Social Security Number (SSN).

    "text": "F-1 CPT (Curricular Practical Training) Curricular Practical\u00a0Training\u00a0(CPT) is an opportunity for international students in F-1 status to participate in professional, temporary employment such as an internship, co-op program, practicum or similar situation, which is undertaken prior to the completion of studies. The training must either be a required part OR an integral part of the established curriculum and the student must receive academic credit for the employment that will count toward degree requirements. Work must be required or an integral part of the program and directly related to major. CPT is NOT a stop-gap or a back door to employment. For work that is directly related to the student\u2019s major, but has no curricular component, the student should consider Optional Practical Training. Important: Employment may begin only after the ISS advisor has authorized the CPT by endorsing your I-20. The I-20 is the official document authorizing the Curricular Practical Training employment. Academic Credit Requirement For the employment, the student must enroll in a class for credit and the class MUST either be required for the degree or the class must qualify as an elective course required for the student\u2019s degree. The period of employment should normally fall within the limits of a given academic term. Students participating in CPT during a fall or spring semester must continue to pursue a full course of study. Both failure to enroll in the specific course for which the CPT is approved and to complete the employment during the period of authorization will result in a violation of immigration status. Eligibility Students are eligible for CPT after they have completed two full semesters (fall and spring) in valid F-1 status (including enrolling full-time each semester and possessing a valid I-20). Time spent on an approved full-time study abroad program may be counted toward the two-semester requirement as long as the student has completed one semester in the U.S. before studying abroad. Students who have finished all course requirements except for thesis, dissertation or equivalent may only participate in CPT if the employment is required in order to obtain data or observations from the employment that will be published in and significantly contribute to the thesis, dissertation or equivalent. Full-Time vs Part-Time Employment may be either full-time (over 20 hours a week) or part-time (20 hours or less a week). If 12 months of full-time CPT is used then no Optional Practical Training (OPT) is permitted at that degree level. Part-time CPT or less than 12 months of full time CPT will not impact the OPT period. Authorization An international student advisor in the International Support Services Office (ISS) authorizes CPT. Employment may not begin until the proper authorization is obtained on page 2 of the student\u2019s I-20 and must end by the authorized completion date. How to Apply Please remember that employment may begin only after the ISS advisor has authorized the CPT by endorsing your I-20. The I-20 is the official document authorizing the Curricular Practical Training employment. Step 1: Offer Letter Click to expand Obtain a letter from the employer specifying the dates of employment, expected hours worked per week, job title, and a job description. Step 2: CPT Course Instructor Click to expand Talk to your CPT course instructor and your academic advisor before submitting the CPT e-forms in iHawk. Step 3: Submit \"CPT Request\" in iHawk Click to expand Log into iHawk using your KU online ID and password. Go to \"F-1 Practical Training\" --> \"CPT Request\". Submit both parts of the e-form group (CPT Part 1 Instructor Recommendation and CPT Part 2 Advisor Recommendation) in order. You may find it helpful to bring a portable device to submit e-forms in front of your course instructor/advisor. If you do, make sure you have a PDF of the employer's letter accessible to upload. Once you submit both e-forms, the instructor you listed in Part 1 will immediately receive an email requesting recommendation of your CPT. When the instructor completes his/her verification, then the academic advisor you listed in Part 2 will receive an email requesting input. Once the academic advisor completes his/her verification, you will receive an email to come to ISS for CPT application processing. Step 4: Meet with ISS Advisor Click to expand Once Part 2 of your CPT e-form request is in \"pending\" status, meet with an ISS advisor during DROP-IN advising, to review and process your request. Please refer to our Advising webpage for more information on advising hours. The ISS advisor will verify your F-1 status and confirm that the employment meets the curricular requirements.\u00a0 If the ISS advisor approves the CPT, a new I-20 will be issued with the employment authorization.

Comply with OPT reporting requirements. Since F-1 status is dependent on employment, you must not accrue an aggregate of more than 90 days of unemployment while on post-completion OPT. OPT employment does not have to be paid, but volunteer or unpaid opportunities do need to be reported in order to avoid accrual of unemployment.\u00a0 Unpaid internships must not violate any labor laws, must be directly related to your field of study and the work must be at least 20 hours per week. The U.S. Department of Homeland Security (not ISS) will be responsible for determining if your status has been violated by exceeding the permissible period of unemployment.\u00a0 They may deny future immigration benefits and/or they may terminate your\u00a0SEVIS record if you fail to maintain the proper period of employment. You are allowed 60 days after the expiration of the EAD\u00a0(if properly maintained status) to remain in the U.S. for the purpose of preparing for departure, to change education levels at the same school, to transfer out, or to apply for a change of status. Your duration of status and possibly also work authorization may automatically be extended if you are a beneficiary of a timely filed H-1B petition and change of status request. See more details on\u00a0H-1B Cap-Gap OPT Extension. OPT Ends If you work and complete the full twelve months of OPT you will have your grace period to depart the United States (60 days), change your immigration status, begin a new degree program at KU, or transfer your SEVIS record to another university. If you transfer your SEVIS record to another university while on OPT, then your OPT will end on the transfer release date. If you accumulate more than 90 days of unemployment, OPT will end. We recommend departing the United States before accumulating 90 days of unemployment. Please submit the Depart the United State and Forfeit OPT eform in your iHawk account. In the situation where you have not worked while on OPT and are leaving, please reach out to ISS to talk about how to receive a partial refund for the ISS OPT fee. Travel Concerns While on OPT Travel out of the U.S. while waiting for OPT approval is not advised unless you have a job offer and you have a way of getting the EAD should the OPT be approved while you are overseas. OPT is Pending OPT Receipt Passport F-1 visa I-20 with a recent travel signature STEM OPT Pending Do not travel outside the United States if your EAD is expired and the STEM OPT extension request is pending.\u00a0 Wait until you receive the new EAD. OPT is Approved OPT EAD (Employment Authorization Document) Proof of Employment (i.e. job offer or recent paycheck stub) Passport F-1 Visa I-20 with a travel signature within the last six months If your F-1 visa has expired you will need to apply for a new one while abroad if you plan to return to the U.S. to continue with OPT.\u00a0 It is sometimes more difficult to obtain an F-1 student visa while on OPT since you have already completed your degree and you are only returning to work.\u00a0 In addition, all new visas require a security check that could take time.\u00a0 Please carefully consider these risks before traveling outside the U.S. If traveling to Canada, Mexico or adjacent (Caribbean) islands for less than 30-days, automatic revalidation may be a possibility and a need for a new visa may not apply.

    "text": "STEM OPT Extension The STEM OPT extension extends the initial 12 months of post-completion OPT an additional 24 months (for a total eligibility of up to 36 months) for students majoring in Science, Technology, Engineering, and Mathematics. The extension can only be granted in a 24-month period; the period cannot be \u201csplit\u201d into multiple periods. KU STEM Degree List (pdf) - as of August 2024 On this page STEM Overview How to apply STEM Reporting Requirements STEM OPT Overview Eligibility Click to expand To be eligible, you must: Be maintaining F-1 status. Currently be on an approved period of post-completion optional practical training (OPT). Students on pre-completion OPT are not eligible for the extension. Apply for the STEM extension based on study in a field on the Eligible CIP Codes for the STEM OPT Extension DHS webpage: See above for a list of KU Degrees that are on the DHS STEM List. The degree used for the current post-completion OPT does NOT have to be in a STEM field. You can apply for the STEM extension based on a prior STEM degree obtained within the last 10 years from a US, SEVP-approved, accredited school. The degree must be at the bachelor\u2019s, master\u2019s or doctoral level. If you are currently on OPT based on completion of required lecture courses with only thesis, dissertation or equivalent left in a STEM field, you can apply for the STEM extension even if you have not yet completed the degree. Work for a U.S. employer in a job directly related to your major area of study in the STEM field. Have a job offer from an employer registered with the E-Verify employment verification system. Not have previously received the STEM OPT extension twice before. For a second extension, your second STEM degree must be at a higher level than the previous STEM degree used for your first STEM OPT extension. Complete, along with your employer, a Training Plan on form I-983. Be paid and work at least 20 hours a week. The wages must be commensurate with other employees doing the same job. Having a job from a temporary staffing agency or consultancy will not qualify for STEM OPT (even if they are registered with E-Verify) unless the employing staffing agency or consultancy will be the entity that provides the practical training experience to the student and they have and maintain a bona fide employer-employee relationship with the student while they may be working at another company where they are placed. E-Verify Employer List Click to expand Google search \u201cEVerify Employer List\u201d. Select the uscis.gov website. At time of publication of this website, the USCIS website is called E-Verify Employers Search Tool Employment Specifics Click to expand Students: Must work in a paid position at least 20 hours per week for an E-Verify employer in a position directly related to the student\u2019s STEM degree. Must have specific training goals and objectives outlined in the Training Plan, Form I-983. May work multiple jobs, but all employers must be enrolled in E-Verify and complete an I-983. Must do annual self-evaluations and have the employer sign off on the self-evaluations. Cannot be self-employed (you cannot sign your own I-983 as an employer). Cannot be employed through \u201ctemp\u201d agencies or consulting firm arrangements that provide labor for hire, or any other relationship that does not constitute a bona fide employer-employee relationship. This is possible only if the employing temp agency or consultancy will be the entity that provides the actual training and supervision to the student and which is explicitly explained in the required I-983 training plan. When to Apply Click to expand Applications for the STEM OPT extension can be filed\u00a0up to 90 days prior to the end of the regular period of post-completion OPT, but USCIS must receive and receipt the application before the current OPT expires. ISS recommends you apply as early as possible (within the required time frame described above) to avoid driver\u2019s license renewal issues. If the STEM application is receipted before the current OPT expiration date, the student can continue working until a decision is made (up to 180 days from the end of the current OPT expiration).

Submit the final e-form #7, which becomes available only after all e-forms #1 - #6 are submitted. This final e-form #7 submission then puts your STEM I-20 request in the ISS queue for review by an immigration advisor. An ISS immigration advisor will review only complete submissions of STEM OPT I-20 requests, in the order the complete submission was received. Review and processing can take 5~7 business days. Pay attention to any emails from ISS. Upon initial review by an ISS advisor, if there are insufficient submissions or questions regarding your request, you will receive an email explaining what is needed. Any subsequent resubmissions after revision will go back into a new queue for review (i.e. 5~7 business days from resubmission). Best Practices To ensure that you receive your STEM OPT recommendation I-20 (if eligible) in the least amount of time, it is critical that you pay attention to all the details and EXAMPLE forms explained in the Steps on creating digital images and preparing supporting documents for your STEM OPT I-20 request. The more your complete submission is accurate, the less chance it will be kicked back for you to revise and resubmit (resulting in more time needed for review and processing). Step 6: Receive New I-20 with STEM OPT Recommendation Click to expand Once your complete STEM OPT I-20 request is reviewed and a STEM OPT recommendation is made, you will receive the new STEM OPT Recommendation I-20 in the manner you selected.

    "text": "Cap Gap Extension The cap gap extension is a period in which an eligible F-1 student\u2019s status is automatically extended to bridge the gap between the end of F-1 status and the start of H-1B status. If the student is in a period of authorized post-completion OPT on or after the date the H-1B petition is received by USCIS, the student\u2019s post-completion OPT is also automatically extended. To Qualify for the H-1B Cap Gap Extension The student must be the beneficiary of an H-1B petition that is subject to the annual H-1B cap; is timely filed (before your F-1 status expires and within the H-1B filing deadline from selection); requests an H-1B employment start date in the fiscal year for which such H-1B status is being requested; requests a change of status (instead of consular notification); AND is nonfrivolous. The student must not have violated terms or conditions of his/her F-1 status.\u00a0 The cap gap extension applies to all F-1 students regardless of their major. Other Guidance The cap gap extension starts when the student\u2019s current period of F-1 status ends, regardless of whether the student was in a period of OPT. The extension is granted automatically at no cost. It is the student\u2019s responsibility to request a new I-20. Cap gap extension is terminated if the H-1B petition is rejected, denied, or revoked.\u00a0 However, the student would have a grace period after the termination during which he/she is authorized to remain in the U.S. for up to 60 days to prepare for departure from the U.S., change degree level, transfer, change status, etc., as long as the student has not otherwise violated status.\u00a0 Employment is not permitted during the 60-day grace period. Students will not be personally notified by DHS when an H-1B is withdrawn, rejected, or denied.\u00a0 The student must remain in contact with the sponsoring employer to check regularly on the status of the H-1B application. If your H-1B petition is rejected, denied, or withdrawn prior to the original OPT end date, then you may continue on OPT until that original end date, followed by a 60-day grace period. The 90-day limitation on unemployment continues during the cap gap extension for those granted an extension of OPT. During the cap gap extension, all students must continue with\u00a0post-comp OPT reporting requirements\u00a0for any change of address, name, or interruption of employment (as appropriate).

Attend Another US School (transfer SEVIS record) Click to expand If you decide to continue your studies at another SEVIS-approved school in the U.S., you must submit a request for an ISS immigration advisor to transfer your SEVIS record electronically to that institution. Keep in mind: Transfer out requests must be submitted and processed BEFORE the end of your 60-day grace period following your program completion date or Optional Practical Training (OPT) end date. The course of study at the transfer-in school must begin at the next available term, which must be within 5 months of the transfer release date from KU or within 5 months of the program completion date on your I-20, whichever is earlier. In the case of a student authorized to engage in post-completion OPT, the student must be able to resume classes within 5 months of the transfer release date from KU or the date the OPT authorization ends, whichever is earlier. You must upload a scan of the admission letter (or any documentation confirming your admission) in your e-form request. The admission term/semester must be listed in this documentation. The \u201cTransfer Release Date\u201d is the date on which your SEVIS record will transfer from KU to the new school. You must maintain status at the transfer-out school until the transfer release date. Any on-campus employment or OPT must end on the transfer release date. On the requested transfer release date, ISS will no longer be able to access your SEVIS record.\u00a0 Your new school will be able to provide you with an updated I-20 only after the transfer release date. In some cases, a SEVIS transfer may not be an option for you. Visit with an ISS immigration advisor to discuss other ways you may be able to accomplish your transfer. How to Request a Transfer: Submit this request ONLY once you have decided to transfer to a specific institution.\u00a0 DO NOT submit the request if you are still waiting on hearing from other schools. Log into iHawk and submit a \u201cTransfer Out\u201d request under \"F-1 Student Services\" -> \u201cLeaving KU\u201d. Once you have submitted the e-form request, come to the ISS office and meet with an immigration advisor\u00a0during drop-in advising hours to have your \"Leaving KU\" (Transfer Out) request reviewed and processed. Withdraw from KU before finishing program Click to expand If you plan to withdraw from KU before completing your program, submit the \u201cWithdrawing from KU\u201d e-form in iHawk . Your request must be reviewed and approved before you drop any courses.\u00a0 An approved request ensures you will have 15 days to leave the U.S. Withdrawing from the university and dropping your courses without authorization will result in a loss of legal F-1 status, and does not allow for a 15-day grace period.\u00a0 If you are already outside the U.S. and decide not to return to resume your degree/program, you must still complete and be authorized for a withdrawal in order for your immigration record to remain in good standing. Keep in mind: You must leave the U.S. within 15 days of the authorization in your SEVIS record. On-campus employment permission ends on the date of authorized withdrawal. Do not drop/withdraw from classes before receiving authorization from ISS. If you are already outside the U.S., you must have the authorization for withdrawal approved by the 20th day of class in the fall or spring term for which you are not enrolling. If you later decide to return to KU as a student, you will need to apply for re-admission (or a return from absence) through the appropriate admissions office, obtain a new SEVIS I-20, and pay a new SEVIS fee to the U.S. government. How to Request Early Withdrawal: Log into iHawk and submit the \u201cWithdrawing from KU\u201d request under \"F-1 Student Services\" -> \u201cLeaving KU\u201d. Once you have submitted the e-form request, come to the ISS office and meet with an immigration advisor\u00a0during drop-in advising hours to have your \"Leaving KU\" (authorized early withdrawal) request reviewed and processed. It is your responsibility to confirm that your withdrawal is authorized by a KU ISS advisor before the deadline or prior to dropping below full time. Completing Studies (Graduate) and leave the US Click to expand F-1 regulations allow a 60-day grace period following the completion of your program at KU \u2013 officially May 31 (for Spring), August 1 (for Summer), or December 31 (for Fall), regardless of what your current I-20 lists as your program end date.\u00a0 The 60-day grace period is provided to allow preparations for departure from the U.S. Keep in mind: On-campus employment is not permitted after the program completion date (during the 60-day grace period). Departure from the U.S. forfeits any remainder of your grace period. If you later decide to return to the U.S. as a student, you will need to apply for admission and obtain a new I-20. Complete the Exit Form: Log into iHawk and submit the \u201cExit Information\u201d form under \"F-1 Student Services\" -> \u201cLeaving KU\u201d.

Reinstatement Eligibility The student: cannot have been out of status for more than 5 months at the time of filing reinstatement (unless the student can demonstrate exceptional circumstances and he/she is filing as promptly as possible); does not have a record of repeated or willful violations of USCIS regulations; is currently pursuing, or intending to pursue a full course of study in the immediate future; has not engaged in unauthorized employment; is not deportable on any other grounds; and establishes to the satisfaction of USCIS by a detailed explanation showing either that the violation of status resulted from circumstances beyond the student\u2019s control (such as serious injury or illness, closure of KU, a natural disaster, or a mistake made by the international student advisor) OR the violation relates to a reduction in course load that would have been in the international student advisor\u2019s power to authorize, and failure to approve reinstatement would result in extreme hardship to the student. Reinstatement Process Overview Write a personal letter explaining circumstances why you are out of status and how you are eligible for reinstatement. Complete USCIS Form I-539 for \u201creinstatement\u201d following USCIS instructions. Request a Reinstatement I-20 from ISS, required for the USCIS application: submit\u00a0request in iHawk (F-1 Student Services --> Regain Legal Status) and upload updated proof of finances Pay form I-901 SEVIS fee, if applicable (SEVIS fee is not required if applying for reinstatement and out of status less than five months).

Detailed steps\u00a0on how to apply provided below. Advantages Do not lose continuity of student status; if reinstated student status is restored. Can (should) remain in the US while reinstatement application is pending. Disadvantages/Consequences If reinstatement is denied you must be prepared to depart the U.S. immediately. Also if denied, the visa you used to enter the U.S. is automatically cancelled; you are permanently limited to applying for nonimmigrant visas in the future only in your home country. How to Apply for Reinstatement Step 1.

We would recommend you seek immediate legal counsel from a qualified immigration attorney. Option 2:\u00a0Travel\u00a0outside the U.S. and re-enter with a new I-20 (Travel & Re-Entry) If you are not eligible or a poor candidate for reinstatement (details above) you do have an alternative method to regain student status. By the travel and re-entry method, you are making an active choice to leave the U.S. and attempt to return. Prior to leaving, you will need to obtain a new I-20 marked \u201cInitial Attendance\u201d from ISS and use the new I-20 to re-enter the U.S. After making a new entry, you will in effect start your student status all over again.

Advantages May be the\u00a0right choice if you had already made plans to travel (i.e. for vacation, to visit family, etc). The speed or convenience of the travel option outweighs applying for conventional reinstatement. No application or fee is required. Upon re-entry and check-in with ISS, your new F-1 status will allow you to resume an assistantship or engage in on-campus employment. Disadvantages May not be the right choice if you are close to completing your degree and plan to apply for optional practical training. With new entry you must wait/maintain student status for one full academic year before regaining eligibility to apply for practical training or any off campus work authorization. Face the risk of a visa denial if you must apply for a new F-1 visa. Face the risk of your admission into U.S. being denied at port-of-entry (even if you are in possession of valid new I-20, passport, and F-1 visa). Pay the $350 SEVIS fee prior to re-entering the U.S., or before applying for an F-1 visa (if new visa is required). Reentry to the U.S. is limited to no earlier than 30 days before the new I-20 program start date.

If you are under the sponsorship of any other J-1 exchange visitor program (i.e., IIE, AMIDEAST, etc.) you need to contact your sponsoring agency. Be in good academic standing at the University of Kansas. Have completed one semester. Have an offer of employment that is directly related to your major field of study, and confirmed by your academic advisor. Employment is expected to be in-person to promote cultural exchange during this academic training.

Already enrolled at KU with non-KU J-1 sponsorship Read the following steps and requirements carefully to transfer your J-1 sponsorship to KU. It is the student\u2019s responsibility to maintain his or her J-1 student status and to complete the process below. Notify your current sponsor of your intent to transfer sponsorship to KU and ask what documentation/process they require. You must have your current program sponsor release your SEVIS record to KU before your current DS-2019 end date. KU cannot produce a KU DS-2019 until after the release date chosen by you and your current program sponsor. If your current program sponsor is the U.S. government (program code on DS-2019 starts with G), you will need to pay the SEVIS fee to the U.S. government.

However, you can have only one status while you are in the United States.\u00a0The visa which is used for your admission to the U.S. becomes the status you will hold. What is immigration 'status' One of the most common sources of confusion is the difference between your visa and your status. Your visa is an entry document. When you present your passport, visa and supporting documents at a U.S. port of entry, you are admitted in a non-immigrant status that matches the classification of the visa in your passport. This is also referred to as \"immigration status\" or \u201cvisa status\u201d. The status in which you are admitted by a Customs and Border Protection (CBP) Officer is stamped in your passport and generates an electronic I-94 Arrival Record . You may also obtain a new status in the U.S. through approval of a change of status application by USCIS. Once you have obtained your status, you need to be aware of what you need to do---and not do-- to maintain your legal non-immigrant status as a student, employee or visiting scholar.",

    "text": "Change of Status by Travel and Re-Entry to the United States To change your status, you must choose one of two methods: Change of Status from Inside the U.S. Change of Status by Traveling Outside of and Re-Entering the U.S. If you are considering changing your current immigration status to a different immigration status, keep in mind that every immigration status has different rules and benefits. You may want to explore the rules and benefits of your current status as well as the one you are considering changing to and visit with an ISS advisor during Immigration Advising Hours to discuss the benefits and consequences of changing your status. ISS primarily advises students who are changing to an F or J category status. If you are planning on changing to a category other than F or J, you may visit with an ISS advisor for general information or you may consider contacting a qualified immigration attorney. Overview In order to change your status by traveling outside of the U.S. and re-entering, you must apply and interview for your new visa category at a U.S. embassy or consulate outside of the United States. The Consulate Officer at the embassy or consulate will consider issuing your requested visa stamp based on your visa application materials and your in-person interview. The amount of time this method will take varies by embassy. Check the visa wait times at your embassy . It is best to apply for your new visa in your home country, or in a country that accepts \"third country national\" applications if travel to your home country is not possible. Not all embassies and consulates will accept \"third country national\" applications, so make sure you check with the embassy where you plan to apply before you make your travel arrangements. Make sure you allow extra time for the visa application process, including sitting for the in-person interview and for any visa processing delays that you may encounter. ISS primarily advises students who are changing to an F or J category status. If you are planning on changing to a category other than F or J, you may visit with an ISS advisor for general information or you may consider contacting a qualified immigration attorney. Supporting Documentation Each U.S. Embassy and Consulate has different requirements for the documentation you will be asked to present during your in-person interview. It is best to have all documentation prepared and with you at the interview, even if the Consulate Officer does not end up asking to review the document.

Postdocs Inside the US when Hired We generally see an F-1 student graduate from a US university and start a postdoc position. In this case they would generally use F-1 Optional Practical Training for 12 months. If they are eligible for STEM extension they should use STEM OPT. If they are not eligible for STEM OPT then we usually transition to the H-1b visa because the hiring department can pay an expedite service fee to the United States government so the change of status from F-1 to H-1b will be adjudicated within 15 business days. Please contact Keeli Nelson in Human Resources. Postdoc Outside the US when Hired If the employee is outside the United States we generally use the J-1 research scholar visa category. Current Immigration Status If the employee is currently in the United States, we will try to use the employee's current immigration status if possible. There are are few issues that are very important that will influence if the employee is able to use their current visa sponsorship or if the employee has to change to a new immigration status. The change of status process can be very significant for specific visa types and this timeline will influence the choice of visa sponsorship.

    "text": "How to Invite Visiting Scholar A Visiting Scholar is an individual who performs collaborative research with a KU faculty member for a limited amount of time. In most cases they are a student or employee at another university. The individual will have a Visiting Scholar affiliate appointment at KU. Processing Time In most cases the internal visa sponsorship request process take 3-4 weeks. Once the visa sponsorship paperwork is complete and International Support Services has issued a DS-2019 form, the scholar will apply for a J-1 visa at a US consulate. That could take as little as a few days to several months. Visa Sponsorship J-1 scholar In most cases we use the J-1 research scholar or J-1 short-term scholar visa category. These two visa types easily fit with the purpose of the visiting scholar who is not paid by KU. These two visa categories also allow for payments like academic honorarium or stipends. For visits that are less than 6 months we can use the J-1 short-term scholar visa category. For visits longer than two weeks, but less than five years we can use the J-1 research scholar visa category. A common length of time is one year. J-1 visa sponsorship process (for KU departments) Both of these J visa categories have the potential to give the visiting scholar a two-year home residency requirement once they finish their visiting scholar program. The J-1 research scholar does have a 24-month bar on repeat participation that prohibits the person from starting a second J-1 research scholar program for 24-months. Visitor Visa/ESTA Travel Authorization The visitor visa should only be used for very short time periods and the research must be independent and KU can not benefit from the research. This last criteria is one of the reasons we rarely use the visitor visa category for Visiting Scholars. Visitor visa information (for KU departments) Payments for Visitor Visa Academic honorarium and other payments to the individual may be possible if the visit to KU is less than 9 days. Please talk with Account Payables. Invitation Letter You may receive a request for an invitation letter from the scholar who needs a letter from KU to support their funding application. Letters should be from the KU faculty host because they will oversee the research at KU. Letters should include: General field of research Brief description of research Exact start and end date they will be at KU Either KU funding (include exact dollar amount) or no funding from KU Additional benefits department is offering scholar (office space, staff assistance, department facilities, etc.) Restricted Party Screening All visiting scholar affiliate appointments must be screened by Global Operations & Security. For those who go through the J-1 visa sponsorship process with International Support Services, this restricted party screening process is part of the application process. For all others, the KU department should reach out directly to GOS and begin the screening.

    "text": "F-1 OPT & STEM OPT Information for KU employer F-1 Optional Practical Training (OPT) F-1 Option Practical Training (OPT) is normally 12 months of work authorization\u00a0 and is typically used by a F-1 international student who just graduated with a degree from a U.S. college or university.\u00a0 To begin work the employee must present a valid Employment Authorization Document (EAD) card issued by USCIS. \u00a0OPT employment is required to be related to the student's degree program. Process The employee should already be working with the international office from their degree granting university. It can take 3-5 months for the employee to get an EAD card from U.S. Citizenship and Immigration Services. This is an interesting type of work authorization in that the employer has no responsibility to maintain the employee's immigration status in the United States.\u00a0 The maintenance of status is performed by the employee and their degree granting institution.\u00a0 If the employee graduated from KU, then the International Support Services office would continue to advise the graduated student and help them maintain their immigration status.\u00a0 OPT employment may be paid or unpaid, full-time or part-time, and includes self-employment. OPT Premium Processing Service US Citizenship and Immigration Services recently started premium processing service (form I-907) for an I-765 petition to apply for Optional Practical Training (OPT). As of Feb 2024, the current fee is $1,685. Premium processing provides expedited processing on Form I-765 for an additional governmental fee. In exchange for the additional fee, USCIS guarantees that it will take some adjudicative action (approval, denial, request for evidence, notice of intent to deny) within 30 calendar days. If the application requires the submission of additional evidence or a response to a notice of intent to deny, the 30-day premium processing period will stop and reset. A new premium processing period will begin when USCIS receives a response to the request for evidence or notice of intent to deny. Once the I-765 petition is approved, an employment authorization document is issued by USCIS and then mailed to the applicant. It usually takes more than one week to print and mail the card. As a reminder, Optional Practical Training is a flexible work authorization. The international student is not restricted in where they may work. If you decide to pay this fee, and OPT is approved, the student may use this work authorization to work at a different employer. How long does the standard OPT petition take, without premium processing service? Historically we have seen the I-765 petition take as little as 5-6 weeks to longer than 5 months. With the start of premium processing service, we are now seeing 3 - 4 months as the average processing period for I-765 petition without premium processing service. USCIS considers 3 months the standard period for this type of petition and the applicant is not able to submit an inquiry until after 4 months of processing. Can a KU department pay this fee? There is no mandate for KU to pay this fee. If you would like to pay this fee, then reimbursement is the recommended method. Please do not share you P-card information with a student. F-1 STEM OPT Extension F-1 students who hold degrees in Science, Technology, Engineering, and Mathematics (STEM) may be eligible to apply for an additional 24 months of Optional Practical Training (OPT), for a total of 36 months. \u00a0Only students who have completed degrees in a STEM designated field qualify for this extension. \u00a0Please contact your degree granting university's international office to find out if your degree program is eligible for STEM OPT. \u00a0In addition to having completed a degree in a STEM field of study, you must have a job offer or be working for an employer registered with \"E-Verify,\" a federal employment verification system, and you and your employer must complete the Form I-983, Training Plan for STEM OPT students. If you continue your employment at KU by using STEM OPT, then your KU Dean, Chair, Director, or supervisor should complete and sign Form I-983, Training Plan for STEM OPT students (pdf) . \u00a0They are referred to as the \"employer\" on Form I-983. \u00a0The employer should complete and sign several sections of the form (section 3, section 4, and section 6). \u00a0Please follow the instructions below for instructions on several fields in section 3. FORM I-765 University of Kansas E-Verify Number: \u00a0264014 FORM I-983 (.pdf) Section 3: Employer Information Employer Name: The University of Kansas Employer Address: 1450\u00a0Jayhawk\u00a0Boulevard, Lawrence, Kansas 66045 Employer Website URL: www.ku.edu Employer ID Number (EIN): 48-1124839 Number of Full-Time Employees in U.S.: 10,089 North American Industry Classification System Code: 611310 Start Date of Employment (or Start date of STEM OPT; whichever is later) Please note that International Support Service staff cannot prepare or sign the Form I-983 on behalf of KU.

    "text": "J-1 Scholar Visa Sponsorship Overview of J-1 Program The purpose of the J-1 Exchange Visitor Program is to increase mutual understanding between the people of the United States and the people of other countries by means of educational and cultural exchanges. Four principal parties are involved in the J-1 Exchange Visitor Program. Department of State (DOS): issues J visas to Exchange Visitors (EV) and their dependents and creates and administers federal regulations and policies governing the Exchange Visitor Program. Exchange Visitor Program Sponsors: legal entities \u2013 such as the University of Kansas that have applied for and received designation from DOS to conduct an Exchange Visitor Program.\u00a0The University of Kansas International Support Service office administers the Exchange Visitor Program (Program Number P-1-00099), and serves as the University\u2019s official representative to Department of State for this program. An ISS staff member serves as the Responsible Officer (RO) for the J-1 program on the Lawrence campus and is the point of contact on any issue that relates to the school's compliance with J-1 program regulations. Exchange Visitors: foreign nationals who have been selected by an exchange visitor sponsor to participate in a particular exchange visitor program. Department of Homeland Security (DHS): manages the Student and Exchange Visitor Information System (SEVIS), admits an alien to the U.S. in J exchange visitor status, and which adjudicates certain immigration benefits for J exchange visitors and their dependents. Primary Activities/Duration and Funding: The University of Kansas, as a J-1 Program Sponsor, can invite J-1 Exchange Visitors to the university for a period of up to five years. Some of these exchange visitors, often referred to as international scholars, are KU employees; others are supported by external funding or by personal funds. Regardless of the funding source, KU Exchange Visitors\u2019 primary activities must consist of teaching, lecturing, observing, or conducting research, and their program must include components of cultural and educational exchange. Although J-1 status allows employment, the primary purpose of the program is not employment, but rather, cultural and educational exchange. Form DS-2019 and the J-1 Visa: Participants in the exchange visitor program will enter the U.S. on a J-1 visa, which is the nonimmigrant visa classification for \u201cexchange visitors.\u201d ISS issues Form DS-2019 to J-1 Exchange Visitors, which will allow them to apply for a J-1 visa at a U.S. consulate.\u00a0 Form DS-2019 will include the Exchange Visitor\u2019s category.\u00a0KU can invite international scholars in the following categories: Professor, Research Scholar, or Short-Term Scholar. Eligibility Requirements Click to expand Intent to pursue appropriate activity. Intent to return to home country. Sufficient funding. Appropriate background for activity. Adequate English language ability Appropriate KU appointment that matches duration of their stay at KU. Health Insurance Click to expand J-1 exchange visitors both employee and visiting scholar are required to maintain KU approved health insurance policy. Examples include the Kansas Board of Regents United Healthcare policy for Visiting Scholar, or Plan J through the State Employee Health Plan. No Tenure or Tenure-Track Positions Click to expand A J-1 professor or J-1 research scholar cannot hold tenure or be placed in a position \u201con a tenure track.\u201d Foreign Medical Graduates Click to expand ISS is authorized to issue a DS-2019 form to foreign medical graduates (M.D.s) to enable them to come to the U.S. for the primary activity of observation, consultation, teaching, or research. They can participate in a non-clinical exchange program, either with NO PATIENT CONTACT OR CARE, or where patient contact is only INCIDENTAL to the primary activity. \u00a0M.D.s with direct patient contact must be sponsored by ECFMG If the J-1 Exchange Visitor is not an M.D., no patient contact is permitted. Two-Year Home Country Physical Presence Requirement Click to expand Certain J-1 exchange visitors may be subject to this requirement for a variety of reasons, including their source of funding and/or the education, training, or skill they are pursuing in the U.S. \u00a0Exchange visitors who are subject to the two-year home country residence requirement must \"reside and be physically present\" in their \"home\" country for an aggregate of two years before being eligible for certain immigration benefits. Prior J Status May Result in Required Waiting Periods Click to expand Prior participation in any J category may subject the prospective exchange visitor to the \"12-month bar\", and prior participation in the Professor or Research Scholar category may subject the prospective exchange visitor to the \"24-month bar\" on repeat participation.. KU Appointment Click to expand All J-1 scholars, regardless of the immigration arrangements, must have an official university appointment indicating they have an academic relationship to KU.\u00a0 Any scholar who will be on the university payroll should be appointed to the specifications of their contract with the hosting department.\u00a0 A copy of this contact will be submitted through iHawk. For those scholars who will not be paid by the university, the appropriate affiliate appointment is generally International Visiting Scholar. Invitation Letter Click to expand All visiting scholars need an official letter of invitation, even KU employees.\u00a0 This letter is critical to the DS-2019 issuance and visa application process.\u00a0 The letter should detail the nature of the research or teaching that the scholar will conduct, who will supervise or advise the scholar, the agreed length of stay and dates the scholar will be on campus, ability to perform research or teaching based on scholar\u2019s English proficiency and specifically what the department will offer the scholar.\u00a0 It may explain if the department will be able to provide office space, staff assistance, departmental facilities, and salary and/or stipend. The invitation letter should include the following information: General field of research Brief description of research / teaching activities (for teaching, list all courses) Exact start and end date Either KU funding (include exact dollar amount) or no funding from KU Scholar meets English language ability to be successful in program Health insurance as requirement of J visa Additional benefits department is offering scholar (office space, staff assistance, department facilities, etc.) Template Invitation Letter (.docx) Minimum Funding Click to expand U.S. law requires J-1 scholars to show they have enough finances to support themselves and any dependents that accompany them at poverty guidelines ; however, we\u00a0strongly recommends that visitors secure access to additional funding to avoid living at poverty levels.\u00a0 Proof of funding must be submitted during the J-1 visa sponsorship process. The minimum estimated cost of attendance is solely used to determine costs for J programs, actual costs may be higher or lower. Current costs are based on financial aid estimated costs of attendance for graduate students who live off campus. Please expect at least a five percent increase in costs due to inflation. If all or part of costs will be covered by KU salary or stipend, it usually takes 6-8 weeks to receive this first paycheck. 2022 \u2013 2023 Required Funding: Housing & Food $15,160 Personal $3,168 Health Insurance $2,831 Total Annual Costs: $21,159 Total Monthly Costs: $1,763 The dependent costs are based on 2023 Federal Poverty guidelines plus the cost for health insurance using the International Student/Scholar health insurance plan with United Healthcare. Annual Dependent $7,971 Monthly add per dependent $664 If the visiting scholar extends their program, additional funding proof must be provided to cover the extension. Funding can come from many different sources.\u00a0 The most common sources are: Home country government Home University Personal savings Support from family members Funding from the KU hosting department English Language Proficiency Click to expand Every J-1 Exchange Visitor must demonstrate their functional level in English prior to participation in a J-1 program in the U.S. This serves two purposes: to ensure all scholars are able to live and function effectively in their host communities and avail themselves of the opportunities for cultural exchange, and to ensure all scholars have the language skills fundamental to the success of their unique J program objectives. Submission of evidence related to the incoming scholar\u2019s functional level in English will be done through iHawk. During the J-1 application process the scholar will be able to choose their method of documentation and upload the appropriate material.\u00a0 Only four options will be accepted: The J-1 is from an English-speaking country (see list below)* The J-1 has attended/is attending university where English is the language of course instruction.\u00a0 Documentation includes copies of transcripts or diploma from US university or website of the institution that shows that course instruction is in English. Submission of a score report from a widely recognized test that details the scholar\u2019s functional level in English. Such tests include TOEFL, IELTS, Cambridge, PTE Academic, and Pearson Verssant. Interview with the J-1, in English, was conducted by KU Applied English Center faculty member. The interview will be conducted using ZOOM. In the application the scholar will have the option to select this choice and will be contacted to schedule an interview. *Examples of English-Speaking Countries based on official language and population usage statistics include: Antigua and Barbuda, Australia, Bahamas, Barbados, Belize, Canada (except Quebec), Cook Islands, Dominica, Grenada, Grand Cayman, Guyana, Ireland, Jamaica, New Zealand, Nigeria, Singapore, Trinidad/Tobago, and United Kingdom. Timeline Click to expand Once the hiring decision or decision to invite the scholar has been made the normal visa sponsorship process takes 3 weeks once all eforms have been completed in iHawk. There are several reasons for this duration, that include KU's Global Operation & Security review for export control issues as well as an interview from the Applied English Center if the scholar has no other method to document their English language ability. The visa application process will depend on which embassy the scholar applies through. There are often significant delays with scheduling an interview. Generally expect 2-3 weeks. If the scholar goes through administrative processing when applying through a visa, expect that the process will take longer than 6 weeks. If the person will be an employee and they do not have a social security number, then once they arrive their SEVIS record must be validate and then they will be able to apply for a SSN. It will probably be 2 weeks before they can begin work. Remote Work Click to expand J-1 scholars must have in-person requirements due to the exchange visitor nature of this program. J-1 scholars cannot be designated as fully remote . If J-1 scholars are designated as hybrid, they can only tele-work a maximum of 2 days per week. Additional work site locations may be added to a J-1 scholar's program. Please contact ISS for details. On this page Overview Hosting Unit Responsibilities Information for Faculty Information for Administrative Contact Fees FAQ about J Status Submit new/initial or extension request Related Content Request Access to iHawk Support Documents Sample Invitation Letter (.doc) Hosting Unit Responsibilities When you invite a scholar and start a J-1 visa sponsorship request, you are responsible for verifying that they\u00a0meet\u00a0the eligibility requirements to come to the United States as a J-1 exchange visitor. The exchange visitor: may be sponsored as a J-1 if they\u00a0will be participating in a program that furthers the\u00a0objectives of the J-1 Exchange Visitor Program must possess sufficient financial support. must possess sufficient English language proficiency for the proposed teaching/research activity. must have appropriate academic credentials for their\u00a0category and position must intend to return to their\u00a0home country. must be aware of the health insurance requirement and maintain health insurance which meets both Federal and University requirements throughout their\u00a0J-1 program. Arrival Click to expand An exchange visitor may enter the U.S. no more than 30 days before the start date indicated in section 3 of the DS-2019. All J-1 exchange visitors must complete the New Scholar Check-In process which consists of an in-person physical presence check-in at International Support Services. New Scholar Check-In has scheduling instructions the physical presence check-in. J-1 Exchange Visitors must upload copies of documents in the New Scholar Check-In form in iHawk. ISS is required by law to verify the exchange visitor\u2019s immigration documentation and report arrivals of exchange visitors to the Department of Homeland Security in SEVIS. J-1 Exchange Visitors must attend the New Scholar Check-In\u00a0no later than 15 days after their DS-2019 start dates\u00a0so that ISS can report their arrival by the government deadline. Missing this deadline has significant consequences; the Exchange Visitor will no longer be in valid J-1 status, will no longer have employment eligibility, and will have to leave the United States. Note: Colleges and universities are required to report information about J-1 Exchange Visitor and their J-2 dependents to the Department of Homeland Security using SEVIS, the Student and Exchange Visitor Information System. It is ISS\u2019s responsibility to comply with SEVIS reporting regulations. Delayed Arrival Click to expand Please let the ISS know as soon as possible about any delay. If the exchange visitor is unable to arrive and report to ISS within 15 days of the start date on the DS-2019, the exchange visitor must submit a Late Arrival form in iHawk, so that a request for an amended start date can be submitted. ISS must update the intended start date in SEVIS to prevent the record from being cancelled by SEVIS. Early Departure Click to expand Since ISS is required to report any changes to the end date of an Exchange Visitor\u2019s J-1 program to the Department of Homeland Security through SEVIS, departments hosting scholars\u00a0must notify ISS\u00a0if a scholar is leaving KU before the end date of the DS-2019 (found in section 3). The exchange visitor should submit a Leaving KU form in their ihawk account to report a scholar\u2019s early departure. Remember that even if your J-1 Exchange Visitor is employed by KU and you terminate his/her appointment with HRM, please notify ISS so that we can document that the Exchange Visitor\u2019s J-1 program has ended. Health Insurance Click to expand All KU J-1 exchange visitors are required to have health insurance which meets University of Kansas standards, for themselves and their dependents, from the start date through the end date of their DS-2019 form.\u00a0These standards are met by Kansas Board of Regents United Healthcare policy for students and visiting scholars. For employees they should select Plan J through the State Employee Health Plan and buy a repatriation and medical evacuation rider. Note: Please remind benefits-eligible Exchange Visitors whose dependents will join them in the U.S. at a later date to enroll their dependents in their KU SEHP insurance plan as soon as their dependents arrive. If the dependents are not enrolled within 30 days of arrival, they cannot be added until the next open enrollment period. J-1 exchange visitors who are not eligible for a KU SEHP health insurance plan should stay enrolled in the KBOR United Healthcare plan, effective from the start date of their DS-2019. General Obligations Click to expand Make sure that your J-1 exchange visitors understand how to enter and update their local addresses and phone numbers in iHawk and help them if they need assistance. U.S. Government guidelines for updating addresses and phone numbers are special for these visitors, so they should follow instructions on the ISS address update website. Cultural Exchange: provide opportunities for your Exchange Visitor to interact with American individuals and groups and experience American culture firsthand. This includes both activities within the department (meetings, seminars, etc.) and activities that have been arranged with the express purpose of enabling the visitor to actively participate in an aspect of American culture, including sports, theater, holiday celebrations, etc., or to gain a deeper understanding of some aspect of U.S. culture. Inviting a J-1 Exchange Visitor: Information for Faculty Inviting a J-1 Exchange Visitor involves faculty, a department administrative contact, International Support Services, and possibly your SSC. Your department will need to complete the J-1 scholar application in iHawk. Once completed ISS will issue Form DS-2019 (Certificate of Eligibility for the J-1 visa), so that the J-1 Exchange Visitor can apply for a J-1 visa in order to enter the United States in J-1 status. The administrative contact is often a member of the human resources group in your unit, but can be anyone who will be able to carry out the responsibilities outlined in\u00a0Inviting a J-1 Exchange Visitor: Information for Administrative Staff. Sometimes faculty take on this additional role as well. Procedures Review the J-1 Exchange Visitor Program overview,\u00a0funding requirements, and department responsibilities.

Key Responsibilities Ensure that the program objective accurately reflects what the J-1 Exchange Visitor will do at KU, and that you have considered cultural and educational exchange components. The administrative contact will need language about the program objectives as well dates for the planned visit. Make sure you understand the exchange visitor's English language ability. If the scholar doesn't have a method to document their language ability, they can interview with an Applied English Center faculty member and a score report will be generated. Verify that the prospective Exchange Visitor has appropriate academic credentials Maintain communication with your exchange visitor, especially about: Delayed arrivals or program cancellations inquiries from ISS about the whereabouts of exchange visitors who have not yet checked in Early departure (before the DS-2019 form end date) of your Exchange Visitor. Your scholar will need to submit a \"Leaving KU\" eform in iHawk so that ISS can update their exchange visitor program Plans to extend your Exchange Visitor\u2019s stay at KU (beyond the DS-2019 end date) Inviting a J-1 Exchange Visitor: Department User Role - Administrative All KU units who host or plan to host J-1 Exchange Visitors (international scholars) should designate one or more administrative contacts to serve as the liaison. This person will have a \u201cdepartment user\u201d role in iHawk that allows them to submit various visa sponsorship cases. Once the Exchange Visitor arrives, the department administrative contact is responsible for on-going issues related to the visitor\u2019s program.

Fees Associated with J-1 Scholars KU International Affairs Fee The division of KU International Affairs has an initial processing cases fee and an extension case fee for any J-1 scholar. This fee can be paid by the department hosting the J-1 scholar or by the scholar themselves. The department will have the option to indicate if they will pay the fee when they submit an initial J-1 visa sponsorship case or J-1 extension request. An invoice will be sent through DARBI at the end of the visa sponsorship process. If the EV will pay the fee they will be sent a payment link in the ISS Store. KU International Affairs Fee Structure I-901 Fee (SEVIS Fee) There is a $220 fee payment the exchange visitor will pay to Department of Homeland Security. In very rare cases we see a KU department pay this fee and if you decide to pay this fee we recommend using a P-card. SEVIS Fee DS-160 Visa Application Fee There is a $185 fee the\u00a0exchange visitor will pay a visa application fee when they apply for a visa at a US embassy. The fee is paid on the country specific embassy website. Frequently Asked Questions About J Status What is a J-1 Exchange Visitor? Click to expand International Support Services is designated by U.S. Department of State as an Exchange Visitor Program Sponsor. Exchange Visitor is the title of a J-1 status holder, which is a U.S. non-immigrant classification. We often also refer to an Exchange Visitor as \u201cEV\u201d, \u201cJ-1\u201d, or \u201cvisiting scholar\u201d. The J-1 exchange visitor status allows temporary educational exchange (which may be either paid or self-funded) in the United States. If you want to invite a scholar to participate at your department in J-1 status, you would\u00a0start a J-1 scholar application for a new exchange visitor. What is a DS-2019? Click to expand The Form DS-2019 is a certificate of eligibility of J-1 status. It is issued by International Support Services through the Department of Homeland Security's SEVIS system. The DS-2019 allows a person to request a J-1 visa to enter the U.S. The DS-2019 also determines the length of a J-1's legal stay in the United States. The\u00a0Hosting Department Responsibilities section of this page outlines the responsibilities when hosting J-1 Exchange Visitors, and general information about the DS-2019 and J-1 status is on our\u00a0page. How Does a Person Become a J-1 Exchange Visitor (scholar)? Click to expand The department at University of Kansas wishing to host the person begins the DS-2019 request process by starting the J-1 scholar application for a new exchange visitor in iHawk. Then both the department administrative contact and scholar will submit information in ihawk. The case will be reviewed by Global Operations and Security for restricted party issues. Once GOS has finished their screening, the administrative contact can route the case to the academic department/research center for final review. At that point ISS will review the entire visa sponsorship request. The request for the visitor\u2019s Form DS-2019 is submitted to the U.S. government's SEVIS system (Student and Exchange Visitor Information System) so that Form DS-2019 can be issued. The\u00a0DS-2019 form\u00a0is either mailed directly to the exchange visitor, or is provided to the department for mailing, depending on the hosting department\u2019s instructions. A $220 SEVIS I-901 fee must be paid and then the scholar should go to an appointment at the U.S. consulate for the J-1 visa. The Exchange Visitor applies for J-1 visa (a visa application fee is also required) at the consulate. When the visa is approved the Exchange Visitor can enter the U.S. with the DS-2019 and J-1 visa up to one month before the start date of the DS-2019. When the Exchange Visitor has arrived in the U.S., they\u00a0must attend J-1 check-in program at International Support Services and will enroll in the health insurance (for the J-1 and any J-2 dependents). What is the 2-Year Rule or 212(e)? Click to expand Under specific circumstances, J-1 and J-2 status holders may incur a two-year home physical presence requirement . If one is subject to the rule, this means that he/she is not eligible to change to H, L or Permanent Residency (PR) classification without first returning to the home country for a total of 2 years. A waiver of this requirement can be applied for and obtained in specific circumstances. If the two-year rule applies, changing status from J to another non-immigrant classification (such as F-1) in the United States is prohibited. The two year rule does NOT prohibit one from returning to the U.S. in any classification besides H, L, or PR. What is the Health Insurance Requirement? Click to expand All J-1 exchange visitors and accompanying J-2 dependents at the University of Kansas are required to have health insurance coverage that always meets the University\u2019s standards. For KU employees that are benefits eligible this means they should enroll in Plan J with the State Employee Health Plan. For Visiting Scholars, they will be required to enroll in the Kansas Board of Regents United Healthcare policy. What is the \u201cCheck-In\u201d Requirement? Click to expand The check-in requirement is linked to the start date of the SEVIS DS-2019. We must report the arrival of the J-1 in SEVIS within the first 30 days after the document begins. If an exchange visitor is delayed and will enter the U.S. more than fifteen days after the DS-2019 start date you should request an \u201camendment\u201d of the DS-2019 so that the start date is changed to a later date. After completing the online Pre-Arrival and Post-Arrival trainings, a newly arrived scholar may call International Support Services to schedule attendance at the New Scholar Check-In. Entry and Exit Time Period Click to expand The scholar may enter the U.S. to begin J-1 status no more than thirty days before the start date of the DS-2019. J-1 exchange visitors are usually granted admission for \u201cduration of status\u201d which is noted as D/S on the admission stamp in the passport and on the Form I-94 printed from CBP I-94 website . With duration of status granted, a J-1 has a thirty day grace period to depart the U.S. after the expiration of the DS-2019. J-2 dependents must depart before or with the J-1. Denied or Delayed Visa Click to expand The University of Kansas is committed to assisting our international students and scholars when possible. If your exchange visitor contacts you to notify you that they have experienced a visa delay or denial, please ask them to notify an international advisor at International Support Services. Housing, schools, transportation, etc Click to expand We have created different checklists for new incoming Employees and Visiting Scholars Travel and Re-Enter Click to expand Please refer to detailed information on our website about\u00a0travel and visa application\u00a0for further details. The U.S. visa (stamp or sticker in your passport) is a travel document which allows entry to the United States with a valid DS-2019. The scholar only needs to have a valid J visa when re-entering the United States; the scholar may remain in the U.S. with the valid DS-2019. If the scholar plans to travel and re-enter the U.S. from abroad after the visa has expired, the scholar needs to apply for a new visa before he/she re-enters U.S. The scholar can only apply for the visa outside the country at a U.S. Consulate. Scholar Inviting People Click to expand The spouse and children under 21 of the J-1 exchange visitor are eligible for J-2 dependent status. The scholar may request a dependent DS-2019 from in iHawk for J-2 dependents during the program. Family members or friends who are NOT children under 21 or the spouse of the J-1 exchange visitor should apply for a B-1/B-2 visitor visa which allows eligibility to visit the United States temporarily for tourism or business purposes. Family members from certain countries may be eligible to travel to the U.S. for visits of up to 90 days without a B-1/B-2 visa through the U.S. Department of State Visa Waiver Program . It is recommended that the scholar give their family members a letter of invitation to document the purpose of their visit. Refer to\u00a0Family Visitors to the U.S.\u00a0for an invitation letter template and more details on the visa application requirements. Outside KU Funding Click to expand In addition to employment at the University of Kansas related to the J-1 objective, J-1 scholars and professors may be eligible to be authorized for incidental employment directly related to the J-1 objective, such as providing occasional lectures or consulting. Incidental employment must be approved in advance by KU International Support Services prior to the activity. For more information, refer to\u00a0Incidental Employment for J-1 Scholars and Professors. Program Extension Click to expand The exchange visitor may be eligible for an \u201cextension\u201d of Form DS-2019 if they have not reached the maximum duration of the J category (see section 4 of the DS-2019) and has not applied for and received a waiver of the Two-Year Foreign Residency Requirement. You, the sponsoring department, would submit an\u00a0a J-1 extension in iHawk. Extension requests should be submitted well in advance of the DS-2019 expiration. For more information on program duration and extension you may contact iss@ku.edu The maximum length of program for Short-term Scholars is six months, for Professors and Research Scholars, five years. Leaving United States Click to expand If the scholar will return home and is ending participation more than 15 days before the end date of the current DS-2019, the end of the program should be reported to Support Services by submitting our\u00a0Leaving KU form If the scholar is leaving within 15 days of the end date of the DS-2019, no action is required. Tax Questions Click to expand KU International Support Services staff members are not authorized to give advice regarding taxes. We do have some helpful information about taxes, tax preparation, ITIN, or tax treaty questions at\u00a0Taxes and Social Security. We strongly recommend they contact Legal Services for Students who has a mandate to provide tax assistance to international students, scholars, and employees. I-901 SEVIS Fee Click to expand The Department of Homeland Security requires a fee of $220 for all new J-1 program applicants to cover the costs of the operation of the SEVIS program. If a future scholar is issued a new DS-2019 for beginning a new program he/she must pay I-901 SEVIS fee. Transfer, extension, or other updates to the original DS-2019 do not require SEVIS fee. You can read more information on our website at in the Travel section and go to the official website for SEVIS fee information and payment . Some departments choose to pay this fee on behalf of the exchange visitor but it is optional. If you do want to pay the fee, you will need the exchange visitor\u2019s SEVIS ID number, name, and date of birth. This information must match the information printed on the exchange visitor\u2019s Form DS-2019. After the SEVIS fee payment is made, a receipt should be printed. The scholar should bring it to the visa interview and when traveling to the U.S. Medical Doctor Click to expand KU-Lawrence campus is authorized to issue a Form DS-2019 to foreign medical graduates (M.D.s) to enable them to come to the U.S. for the primary activity of observation, consultation, teaching, or research. They can participate in a non-clinical exchange program, either with NO PATIENT CONTACT OR CARE, or where patient contact is only INCIDENTAL to the primary activity. M.D.s with direct patient contact must be sponsored by ECFMG . Examples of acceptable activities that involve no patient contact or incidental patient contact: Doing a diagnostic examination in the presence of a senior physician who repeats the exam or ensures at every step that it is done correctly, and the proper diagnostic information is obtained. Being present during therapies and treatment with opportunities for hands-on experience in ways that do not compromise the care of the patient. Being present in the operating room and having limited patient contact, but not performing procedures. In order for a foreign medical graduate to be sponsored by University of Kansas's J-1 program, the department must provide one of the following statements written and signed by the dean or the dean's designee on University of Kansas letterhead: If no patient contact or care is involved: \u201cThis letter certifies that the program in which (EV's name, M.D.) is to be engaged is solely for the purpose of observation, consultation, teaching, or research and that no element of patient care services is involved.\u201d More Questions?

    "text": "Visitor Visa The B-1 visa is for a visitor coming temporarily to the United States generally for short business.\u00a0 The B-2 visa is generally for pleasure or medical treatment.\u00a0 Visitors may use the B-1 visa for brief stays, usually less than six months, to participate in scientific, educational, professional or business conventions, conferences, or seminars.\u00a0 The B visa is not appropriate for students or long-term scholars coming to the University of Kansas. If a department at KU wishes to invite someone using the B-1 visa category, the department will need to write an invitation letter. \u00a0International Support Services will be happy to review the letter. Visa Waiver Program Citizens of a limited number of countries are permitted to visit the United States up to 90 days without a B-1/B-2 visa under the Visa Waiver Program , also known as ESTA travel. Visitors entering for business purposes are admitted in WB status and visitors entering for pleasure are admitted in WT status. The B-1/B-2 and WB/WT categories are very similar but they do have some important differences. Visitors admitted in WB/WT status cannot extend their permission to remain in the United States beyond 90 days and they cannot apply for a change of status. They must fulfill certain passport requirements and pre-screeening requirements. Individuals visiting the United States under the Visa Waiver Program will need pre-clearance authorization called ESTA prior to traveling.\u00a0 They must present evidence of ESTA approval at the port of entry to the United States.\u00a0 Please be sure to print out the approval when applying for ESTA. Employment Employment is not permitted on the B visa.\u00a0 However, a B-1 visitor may be given reimbursement for travel and living expenses.\u00a0 A B-1 visitor may be paid an honorarium for \"usual academic activities\" as long as the academic activity does not last longer than nine days at any institution and the visitor may not have accepted similar payments from more than five institutions during the previous six months. Obtaining a B visa Individuals should contact the U.S. embassy or consulate in their country for instructions on the visa application process and processing times.\u00a0 There is no visa document specific to the B visa, but applicants must show the purpose of the visit to the United States.\u00a0 If a KU department is inviting the B visitor on official business, the letter should cover the following points: the nature of the visit is temporary the individual will not be a salaried employee the individual has their own funding (name source) the individual's position/occupation in their home country the individual will have return passage Taxes Employers are required to withhold 30% of the honorarium payment for tax purposes.\u00a0 B visitors are not eligible to obtain a Social Security Number or an Individual Tax Identification Number.",

    "text": "About your visa What is a Visa A U.S. visa is an entry document. You can apply for an entry visa only at a U.S. embassy or consulate outside the United States. It is placed on a page in your passport\u00a0and certifies that the consular officer has found you eligible to apply for admission at a U.S. port of entry in a particular classification, such as F-1 student, J-1 research scholar, or H-1B assistant professor. The CBP (Customs and Border Protection) officer makes the final decision on whether you are eligible to enter the U.S. with the visa\u00a0and determines the length of time you may stay. Things to Know About a U.S. Visa Length of Stay Click to expand The visa expiration date is the date until which you can re-enter the U.S. in the same classification with valid, unexpired supporting documents. The period of time you may remain in the U.S. is connected to the end of an academic program, or an authorized period of research or employment. Your visa may expire while you\u2019re in the U.S. If your visa expires while you are in the U.S. it has no effect whatsoever on your status.\u00a0However, if your visa is expired when you leave the U.S. to travel abroad, you will need to renew your visa at a U.S. consulate or embassy to return in the same status. Length of Visa Validity Click to expand The length of a visa's validity is based on reciprocity agreements between your country and the United States. The reciprocity agreements address both the duration and\u00a0the number of entries that are allowed.\u00a0A consular officer, after review of an individual\u2019s visa application, has discretion in the application of the reciprocity agreement. What to know more? Learn about the reciprocity agreements . Lost Passport Click to expand After you have your passport replaced, you can apply for a new visa only at a U.S. consulate or embassy abroad. Use Correct Visa Click to expand If you have visited the U.S. for different purposes, you may have more than one visa in your passport. However, you can have only one status while you are in the United States.\u00a0The visa which is used for your admission to the U.S. becomes the status you will hold. What is Status? One of the most common sources of confusion is the difference between your visa and your status. Your visa is an entry document. When you present your passport, visa and supporting documents at a U.S. port of entry, you are admitted in a non-immigrant status that matches the classification of the visa in your passport. This is also referred to as \"immigration status\" or \u201cvisa status\u201d. The status in which you are admitted by a Customs and Border Protection (CBP) Officer is stamped in your passport and generates an electronic I-94 Arrival Record . You may also obtain a new status in the U.S. through approval of a change of status application by USCIS. Once you have obtained your status, you need to be aware of what you need to do---and not do-- to maintain your legal non-immigrant status as a student, employee or visiting scholar.

If, however, your country of citizenship is on this list you may enter the U.S. using your passport until its actual expiration date. Contact Consulate Contact your consulate/embassy well in advance of your passport expiration. Contact the nearest consulate or embassy in Washington D.C. seven to eight months before your passport's expiration date to learn what you must do to renew it and how long it will take. This process often takes longer than expected! Keep your expired passport. You should keep your expired passport for your records. If your expired passport has an unexpired F-1 or J-1 visa in it, you can continue to use the unexpired visa along with your new passport. Be sure to travel with both passports.

    "text": "J-1 Scholars About the J-1 Scholar Program The University of Kansas has been approved by the U.S. Department of State to sponsor J-1 Exchange Visitors\u00a0participating\u00a0in academic research, teaching, and observation at KU. International Support Services facilitates\u00a0J-1 Exchange Visitor program sponsorship for international individuals\u00a0coming to KU with official appointments such as visiting faculty, postdoctoral researchers, fellows, as well as other temporary academic appointments. The J-1 visa\u00a0cannot be used\u00a0for tenure-track appointments or other appointments that are \"permanent\" in nature. The KU hosting department should\u00a0initiate\u00a0the J-1 Scholar Application for a New Exchange Visitor\u00a0on our iHawk website. There are three different types of J-1 scholars. Research Scholar Category Click to expand This J-1 Research Scholar\u00a0exchange visitor category has a minimum stay requirement of three weeks, and a maximum permitted stay of five years.\u00a0\u00a0This five-year stay begins with the start date on the\u00a0DS-2019 form and this status\u00a0remains\u00a0available until the end of the five years or the date the J-1 program is concluded, whichever is earlier. Generally,\u00a0the\u00a0primary purpose of the research scholar exchange visitor is collaborative research with a KU faculty member. We allow limited employment on the research scholar\u00a0exchange program. An example would be a Postdoctoral Researcher.\u00a0Otherwise,\u00a0the exchange visitor is employed or a student at another university and will be a visiting scholar at KU. The visiting scholar affiliate appointment is a non-paid appointment. At KU, the\u00a0initial\u00a0DS-2019 form will be issued for the duration of the official KU appointment and can be extended in concert with the underlying KU appointment being extended.\u00a0\u00a0However, when the program at KU is completed, J-1 status is also completed unless the scholar transfers\u00a0immediately\u00a0to another J-1 sponsor in the U.S. Paid employment for J-1 research scholars is\u00a0permitted\u00a0only if it is included on the Form DS-2019.\u00a0\u00a0In most cases it is not possible for a J-1 scholar to accept paid employment outside of KU however there are exceptions\u00a0permitted\u00a0for occasional lectures and short-term consultations that have the prior approval of International Programs. Such activities must be\u00a0directly related\u00a0to the program activities of the J-1 Scholar. Please review the\u00a012- and 24-month\u00a0bars section\u00a0as well as the\u00a02-year home residency requirement section\u00a0for further details\u00a0regarding\u00a0restrictions on J participation and\u00a0eligibility. Professor Category Click to expand This J-1\u00a0Professor\u00a0exchange visitor category has a minimum stay requirement of three weeks, and a maximum permitted stay of five years.\u00a0 This five-year stay begins with the start date on the\u00a0DS-2019 form and this status remains available until the end of the five years or the date the J-1 program is concluded, whichever is earlier. A person does not have to have a Professor employment title to use this category. The purpose of this professor exchange visitor category is they will primarily teach classes at KU, while research is a secondary purpose. We commonly see Visiting Assistant Professor and Lecturer employment titles\u00a0using this\u00a0category. At KU, the initial DS-2019 form will be issued for the duration of the official KU appointment and can be extended in concert with the underlying KU appointment being extended.\u00a0 However, when the program at KU is completed, J-1 status is also completed unless the scholar transfers immediately to another J-1 sponsor in the U.S. Paid employment for J-1 research scholars is permitted only if it is included on the Form DS-2019.\u00a0 In most cases it is not possible for a J-1 scholar to accept paid employment outside of KU however there are exceptions\u00a0permitted for occasional lectures and short-term consultations that have the prior approval of International Programs. Such activities must be directly related to the program activities of the J-1 Scholar. Please review the\u00a012- and 24-month bars section\u00a0as well as the\u00a02-year home residency requirement section\u00a0for further details regarding restrictions on J participation and eligibility. Short-term Scholar Category Click to expand The J-1 Short-Term Scholar category can be used when the academic objective for the visit can be completed within six months or less.\u00a0 It is not possible to extend beyond 6 months, so if the objective might take more than six months this category should not be considered.\u00a0 This J category is often used for lectures, observations, consultations, or to participate in seminars, workshops, conferences or professional meetings. The J-1 Short-Term Scholar may return to the United States again for a\u00a0short term\u00a0stay providing there is a substantive break between, and each visit constitutes a new objective. This category is not subject to the\u00a012 and 24 month bars. Eligibility Requirements English Language Ability The host KU department must determine that the individual has the appropriate academic credentials, as well as English language proficiency to be successful in his or her program. The scholar will be able to submit documentation during the visa sponsorship process. If the short-term scholar does not have documentation, then they will be able to interview with the Applied English Center. That score report will be made available to the department so they can determine if the scholar\u2019s English language ability is proficient. Minimum Funding Requirements Must provide evidence of financial support (either KU or outside KU) for all expenses, including financial support for all accompanying family members. The minimum estimated cost of attendance is solely used to determine costs for J programs, actual costs may be higher or lower. Current costs are based on financial aid estimated costs of attendance for graduate students who live off campus. Please expect at least a five percent increase in costs due to inflation. If all or part of costs will be covered by KU salary or stipend, it usually takes 6-8 weeks to receive this first paycheck. Please make sure that you have sufficient money to pay for large expenses like deposit for your apartment. 2022 \u2013 2023 Required Funding: Housing & Food $15,160 Personal $3,168 Health Insurance $2,831 Total Annual Costs: $21,159 Total Monthly Costs: $1,763 The dependent costs are based on 2023 Federal Poverty guidelines plus the cost for health insurance using the International Student/Scholar health insurance plan with United Healthcare. Annual Dependent $7,971 Monthly add per dependent $664 The above minimum funding requirements are just that, a minimum. We recommend having funding of $2,000 per month and you will probably spend more than that your first month. You will need to pay a security deposit of at least the first month rent, though often times the security deposit is two months rent. KU Appointment Requirement All scholars are required to hold a formal appointment at the University of Kansas, such as Visiting Faculty, Postdoctoral Researchers, Fellows, as well as other temporary academic appointments.\u00a0 The J-1 visa\u00a0cannot\u00a0be used for tenure-track appointments. J-1 scholars must have in-person requirements due to the exchange visitor nature of this program. J-1 scholars cannot be designated as fully remote . If J-1 scholars are designated as hybrid, they can only telework a maximum of 2 days per week. Health Insurance Requirement The exchange visitor and her/his accompanying family members must maintain health insurance that meets both the Kansas Board of Regents University of Kansas and U.S. Department of State requirements. J-1 Responsibilities As a J-1 research scholar, professor, or short-term scholar there are numerous regulations that must be followed to maintain legal J status: Complete online check-in through your iHawk account Attend New Scholar Orientation with International Support Services after arrival in the United States. Maintain health insurance coverage throughout entire period of J status. Health insurance must meet U.S. Department of State requirements. Always maintain a valid passport. Maintain valid DS-2019 form, which accurately reflects your purpose for being at KU. If it is close to expiring, request an extension from host department. Obtain\u00a0travel signature on DS-2019 prior to traveling outside the United States. You can request a travel signature by submitting the \"Travel Signature Request\" form in your iHawk account. Report any life event that may affect immigration status such as birth of a child, marriage, change of legal name, divorce, or death. This rule also extends to J-2 dependents. Receive\u00a0employment authorization prior to the start of any activity. Report any change of address through your iHawk account within 10 days. 2-Year Home Residency Requirement One of the\u00a0most misunderstood\u00a0aspects of the J Exchange Visitor Program is the 2 Year Home Residency Requirement.\u00a0 This rule which is put in place by the U.S. State Department (and in some circumstances in collaboration with foreign governments) requires that certain J Exchange Visitors return to their country of last legal residence for two years or obtain a waiver of this requirement before they are eligible for\u00a0H-1B\u00a0(temporary employment), L-1 (intra-company\u00a0transfer), K (fiancee\u00a0visa) or Permanent Residence (green card) status within the U.S. It is important to understand that not all J Exchange Visitors are subject to this requirement.\u00a0\u00a0Additionally,\u00a0those that are subject to this requirement are not prohibited from returning to the U.S. in immigration statuses other than H-1B, L-1, K, or PR.\u00a0 For\u00a0example,\u00a0if you are subject to this rule and would like to return to the U.S. as a tourist or a student you are eligible to do so. Who is Subject to the Requirement Click to expand J-1 Exchange Visitors and their J-2 dependents (legal spouse and children under age 21) who meet at least one of the criteria below are subject to the 212(e): Home Government Funding :\u00a0J Exchange Visitors who receive funding directly from their home country's government are subject to the 212(e)\u00a0requirement. Regional government funding does not apply. U.S. Government Funding :\u00a0J Exchange Visitors who receive funding directly from the U.S. government are \"subject\" to 212(e).\u00a0 This does not include salary you receive from the University of Kansas that is received from federal grants, only direct U.S. government funds. However, there are some exceptions which include grants that are specifically targeted for international exchange. Fulbright funding is considered U.S. government funding. Funding from an International Organization or Bi-National Commission :\u00a0J Exchange Visitors who receive funding from International Organizations or Bi-National Commissions (organizations that receive their funding from government sources), such as, United Nations, NATO, or the European Community. The Exchange Visitor Skills Lis t: J Exchange Visitors whose area of specialization has been identified as being in short supply by his/her government of legal permanent residence is considered \"subject\" to the\u00a0Two-Year\u00a0Home Residency Requirement.\u00a0Here is the U.S. Department of State website with information. Graduate Medical Education and Training : All J Exchange Visitors who are foreign medical graduates who come to the U.S. to receive graduate medical education and/or training are subject to 212(e). Are J-2 Dependents Subject? Click to expand If you are the J-2 dependent of a J-1 Exchange Visitor who is subject to the 212(e) requirement you are also subject to this requirement. Please note that J-2 dependents must rely on the J-1 to apply for a waiver of the 212(e)\u00a0requirement. J-2s may not apply for the waiver separately from the J-1. What Should I do if I am Subject? Click to expand There is often confusion about\u00a0whether\u00a0individuals are subject to 212(e).\u00a0 Do not assume that your visa stamp or DS-2019 have been marked correctly by U.S. government agencies.\u00a0 If any of the above statements are correct, you are subject,\u00a0whether\u00a0your documents are marked.\u00a0 If you have\u00a0confusion,\u00a0we strongly encourage you to come to speak with an advisor in International Support Services.\u00a0 We can assist you in the process of requesting an Advisory Opinion from the U.S. Department of State. I Would like to Pursue a Waiver Click to expand The application process details are available on the Department of State website: Waiver of the Exchange Visitor Two-Year Home-Country Physical Presence Requirement . Important : it may be possible to waive this requirement, if you wish to do\u00a0so,\u00a0please make an appointment with an international advisor in International\u00a0Support Services\u00a0before you begin the waiver process. 12- and 24-month bar These bars restrict starting a J-1 research scholar or J-1 professor exchange visitor program.\u00a0\u00a0The 24-month bar is different than the 2-year home residency requirement. 12-Month Bar Time spent in the United States in any J status (including J-2) during the 12-months preceding the start date of the new professor or research scholar program may prohibit eligibility to begin the new program.\u00a0\u00a0Exceptions to this bar are: Transfer between program sponsors does not trigger the bar. Less than 6 months in J status does not trigger the bar. Participation in a J Short-term scholar program does not trigger the bar. 24-Month Bar Anyone who\u00a0participates\u00a0in a J-1 Professor or J-1 Research Scholar program will become subject to a 24-month bar on repeat participation in both Professor and Research Scholar categories.\u00a0 This means that you can not begin a second Professor or Research scholar program for 24 months when you complete the first program. This 24-month bar applies under two circumstances: If the Professor or Research Scholar completes a full five years with one or more sponsors. If, before the full five-year period is over, the Professor or Research Scholar completes the program.\u00a0\u00a0In this case the remaining unused time is no longer accessible and must wait\u00a024 months\u00a0before beginning a new program as a J-1 Professor or Research Scholar The 24-month bar should not be confused with the\u00a0two-year home residency requirement.\u00a0\u00a0These are two completely different regulations. The two-year home residency requirement may apply to visitors in any J category.\u00a0\u00a0The 24-month bar only applies to J-1 Research Scholar or Professor categories or as a J-2 dependent of a J-1 Professor or Research Scholar. New Scholar Orientation and Check-In New Scholar Check-In Prior to your arrival in the United States please complete the New Scholar e-forms in iHawk . \u00a0 These forms gather required information for our office that includes your residential address in Lawrence, emergency contact information, a responsibility statement and submitting copies of your immigration documents (Form DS-2019, visa, passport, I-94 record) as well as health insurance information.\u00a0 Please try to submit as much as possible before your arrival. We recommend you print your I-94 record because you may need it for other purposes. New Scholar Orientation Register for New Scholar Orientation in your iHawk account .

J-1 participants who are Visiting Scholars must purchase the Kansas Board of Regents policy through United Healthcare. J-1 participants who are employees should purchase the State Employee Health Plan, plan J coverage. KU Employee Click to expand You must sign up within 30 days of your employment start date. Please work with the Benefits Office at KU. They can help you with the online application in the member access portal in your KU account. Choosing Plan J The University of Kansas has several different health insurance policies to choose from. However, Plan J is designed to meet the deductible requirement of the J visa health\u00a0insurance\u00a0requirements. The other plans have a larger deductible so they will not\u00a0comply with your requirements. If you do not choose plan J, then you will have to buy other health insurance. Please note that Plan J does not have a medical evacuation or repatriation built into the plan. You will need to purchase an insurance policy rider that covers those two aspects. Other employees in this situation have purchased BETINS medical evacuation\u00a0and repatriation in addition to plan J. There will be a slight gap in between the start date of your DS-2019 form and when your KU employee health insurance benefits begin. You will need to purchase temporary health\u00a0insurance to cover the gap. This temporary health insurance must comply with the J visa health insurance requirements. Benefits Office website BETINS medical evacuation and repatriation Visiting Scholar Click to expand The University of Kansas has negotiated a policy for J students and visiting scholars with a health insurance company called United Healthcare. This policy is very similar to the policy that KU employees have through the state of Kansas. Submit Enrollment Form United Healthcare Rates If you would like to try to use a different health insurance policy you may submit a waiver request to ECI services . Outside KU Lecture/Consultation J-1 professor and J-1 research scholars may participate in occasional lectures and short-term consultations, if authorized to do so by ISS prior to starting the activity. The following criteria must be satisfied: The occasional lectures or short-term consultation must: Be directly related to the objectives of the J-1 exchange visitor's program; Be incidental to the exchange visitor's primary program activities; Not delay the completion date of the visitor's program; and Be documented in SEVIS. Employment opportunities Work authorization is limited for J-1 scholars.\u00a0 Very often the only type of work authorization that can be approved is when your hosting department wants to hire you to perform your specific program activities (research/teaching). If you have an opportunity for employment, please contact International Support Services immediately.\u00a0 Work authorization must be preapproved.\u00a0 International Support Services will write a formal authorization letter and add this information to your SEVIS record. Academic Honorarium Sometimes a department or another university wishes to pay a J-1 scholar an academic honorarium. For example you could give a one-time talk or presentation and the institution wishes to compensate you for the activity. This is considered remuneration and needs to be pre-approved by International Support Services. International Support Services will write a formal authorization letter. Reimbursement of travel expenses If a conference, seminar, workshop or any organization wishes to reimburse you for travel expenses please contact International Support Services before you accept. This type of reimbursement of expenses isn\u2019t usually considered remuneration, however, it can be complicated.\u00a0 Please contact International Support Services and we can write an authorization letter so that there is no confusion about you accepting the reimbursement. Sometimes the conference or institution will require an authorization letter to release funds. Other funding scenarios If you have a different funding opportunity, please contact International Support Services.\u00a0 We will determine what, if any, written authorization needs to happen before you accept the funding while you are a J-1 scholar. Documentation for authorization letter Letter from faculty advisor or department head recommending the activity and explaining how the activity will enhance the scholar\u2019s J-1 program. Letter from the institution/conference with terms and conditions, including street address of where the activity will take place, the duration of the activity, field or subject, amount of compensation (if any), and description of the activity. J-1 Extension If the department wishes to extend the stay of a visiting scholar, they may request an extension of the visiting scholar\u2019s J-1 status.\u00a0 The KU department request to extend must be submitted through\u00a0iHawk. The following conditions must be met before an extension can be approved. The program must not extend beyond the maximum duration (6 months to 5 years depending on the J scholar category). The program activity (research activity or teaching activity) will not change. Scholar must provide proof of additional financial support covering the full extension time period. Scholar must provide proof of health insurance coverage for extension time period. Travel Outside the United States If you need to exit the United States and return to the University of Kansas to continue your J-1 exchange visitor program, then you will need a travel signature on your DS-2019 form. Please first submit a travel signature request within your iHawk account. Your KU faculty host will confirm they know your travel plans and that you have been performing your J-1 research/teaching activities at KU. Once they complete this form, please bring your DS-2019 form into International Support Services. You will be able to pick up the DS-2019 form within 2 business days. Leaving the University of Kansas Please talk with your KU department about any procedure they may have to finish your J-1 program. You may need to return keys to offices or other practical steps. You will lose access to KU email and other technology support with the end of your appointment. Finish Program Early If you will finish your J-1 program more than 30 days before the end date of your DS-2019 form, please submit a \"Finish J-1 program\" eform in your iHawk account so that ISS can issue a new DS-2019 form with the updated information. Transfer SEVIS to Another University If you wish to transfer your J-1 program to another university, it must happen before the end date of your current DS-2019 form. Please make an appointment to talk with an international advisor in ISS. The advisor will need an invitation letter/offer letter from the new university.

    "text": "B-1/B-2 Visitor Overview of the Visitor Visa The B-1 visa is for a visitor coming temporarily to the United States generally for short business.\u00a0 The B-2 visa is generally for pleasure or medical treatment.\u00a0 Visitors may use the B-1 visa for brief stays, usually less than six months, to participate in scientific, educational, professional or business conventions, conferences, or seminars.\u00a0 The B visa is not appropriate for students or long-term scholars coming to the University of Kansas. Visa Waiver Program Citizens of a limited number of countries are permitted to visit the United States up to 90 days without a B-1/B-2 visa under the Visa Waiver Program. Visitors entering for business purposes are admitted in WB status and visitors entering for pleasure are admitted in WT status. The B-1/B-2 and WB/WT categories are very similar but they do have some important differences.

This is because KU employees are paid every two weeks. So you will work for two weeks and then your paycheck is deposited in your account a week later. You can view the payroll calendar, by going to the Payroll website and then click on the menu and then Calendars. If you do not have a social security number, you will also need to apply for a social security number before you can complete on-boarding. If you will use the J-1 visa while working at KU, then your SEVIS record must be validated before you apply for a social security number.\u00a0 If you apply before your SEVIS record is validated it will take significantly longer for your social security number to be approved and issued.

Renter's Insurance Click to expand It is important to consider purchasing renter's insurance while in the United States.\u00a0 Generally, a landlord is not legally responsible for loss or damage to a renter's property. Also, if a renter causes damage to the landlord's property, even unintentionally, the landlord may have the right to hold the renter financially responsible.\u00a0 In both of these cases, renter's insurance would protect the renter from having to pay potentially very large amounts of money.\u00a0 There are many insurance companies, here are two: Progressive\u00bb State Farm\u00bb Utilities: Gas, Electric, Cable, Internet Click to expand Electric: Evergy Energy Gas: Black Hills Energy City Water, Sewer, Trash Removal: City of Lawrence (start/stop/transfer service), Pay Your Bill Online Internet / Cable Television: Midco and Uverse are the local cable providers, but there are many other options such as satellite and phone company.

The Betty Grimwood Thanksgiving Host Program at The University of Kansas is coordinated by the department of International Support Services. \u00a0It provides international students the opportunity to experience the Thanksgiving holiday with an American family. \u00a0For many of these students, this will be their first experience in an American home. The success of the program depends upon families who will extend their hospitality to students from other lands. \u00a0These students do not expect to be entertained constantly throughout the holiday. \u00a0They simply want to view and experience how Americans celebrate Thanksgiving and everyday life. *Note: The application for this program will close on November 14th . Common Questions from Hosts Who Participates? Click to expand The international students who sign up may come from any of the nearly 100 different countries represented at the University. \u00a0Participants can be of any nationality or age. \u00a0Occasionally, a married couple will choose to participate. Most students have no difficulty with the English language; however, there may be a few participants who are here studying English and have a more limited vocabulary. Why Host International Students for Thanksgiving? Click to expand Almost all international students come to the United States with the hope of experiencing the different aspects of American life as well as share their own culture. \u00a0This program provides an excellent opportunity for international students to view life from a non-university setting and serve as \u201cambassadors\u201d for their own cultures and customs. How Does the Program Work? Click to expand During International Student Orientation, we explain the program and invite interested individuals to apply. \u00a0We also advertise the program in various campus and community media. We try to match interested students with families of similar interests and requests. Families and students will receive general information about each other approximately one week before the scheduled stay. We ask the students to call or email the families to introduce themselves. \u00a0Then, we ask the students and families to make direct contact with each other to finalize expected arrival times and locations. The family should expect to provide transportation for the student(s). Many international students do not have cars. We will ask all participating students and hosts to complete a waiver form prior to the event, as required by KU policy. How Does A Family Get Involved? Click to expand We hope that you are interested in the Homestay Program and would like to host a student! \u00a0If so, please click the button above to fill out the application. Common Questions from Students Is It Free, or Do I Have To Pay To Participate? Click to expand This experience is free to all international students and scholars from KU. However, we do charge a refundable $25.00 deposit, to make sure that the students who sign up do participate.\u00a0All students who attend dinner as expected will receive a full refund of the $25.00 deposit. The American families who volunteer to host often spend a lot of time, money, and energy preparing the meal and get excited about sharing their home. We want to make sure that the students who sign up do participate, and we don't disappoint our volunteer hosts. We understand that things may come up - if an emergency occurs after you have been matched with your hosts and you cannot attend, please contact ISS at issprograms@ku.edu. Depending on the circumstances and how much advance notice you are able to provide, you may receive a refund. Otherwise, you forfeit your deposit. Will Hosts Be Able to Accommodate My Dietary Restrictions? Click to expand We work hard to place our students with hosts who can accommodate dietary restrictions, and ask questions about this on the sign up form for both hosts and students so we can make accurate matches. However, all hosts participate on a volunteer basis and may be preparing a very traditional Thanksgiving meal for their extended family and friends, in addition to hosting international students. To help you have an enjoyable and successful experience, we encourage you to: Submit your dietary restrictions on the sign up form. Share any concerns or preferences with your hosts when you introduce yourself. On Thanksgiving, ask your hosts about what is in each dish. They will work hard to provide you with a good meal that fits your needs, however, there may be many dishes and they may forget. What is The Time Commitment for Students? Click to expand Hosts often pick their students up in the morning or early afternoon on Thanksgiving day, and return the students in the evening, after dinner ends. Students should plan to keep all of Thanksgiving Day free. Once they are matched, it is the responsibility of the students and hosts to communicate with each other about the details of arrival and departure times. Homestay option: Some hosts live further away, and are interested in hosting over-night students for a multi-day stay. If you are open or interested in seeing more of Kansas and building a deeper connection with your hosts, please indicate on the form that you are interested in the homestay. I Have Dependents. Can They Attend Too? Click to expand Yes ! Many of our host families have children and grandchildren who may be present. They often welcome the spouses and children of our international students. Please indicate how many dependents you have on the sign up form so we can plan accordingly. Can My Friend and I Sign Up Together? Click to expand Yes! If you would like the same host as another international student friend or roommate, please mention that you would like to be placed together when you complete the sign up form. You both must submit the form. Newspaper article from February 6, 1959 about the original host program started by Betty Grimwood. Former international student with their first Thanksgiving turkey!

Individuals who are eligible for KU employee insurance must enroll within 30 days from your first day of work. Please contact the Benefits Office for help in applying for the State Employee Health Plan.\u00a0 Your health insurance coverage should begin your first day of work. However, this will require that you complete on-boarding, which requires you to have a SSN. It may take you several days, or weeks to obtain a SSN. J Visa Holder Employees The J visa requires that you have health insurance for the entire duration you are in the United States. Since your state employee health insurance will not begin immediately, you will need to purchase a temporary health insurance policy to cover the gap. KU employees who are using a J visa should know that the KU employee insurance does not meet all the U.S. Department of State minimum insurance requirements. This is because this insurance does not include evacuation or repatriation. \u00a0Therefore scholars and their dependents covered by KU employee insurance are also required to be covered by a separate Emergency Evacuation/Repatriation insurance plan. Most scholars purchase this additional insurance through the BETiNS insurance or United Healthcare Global Emergency Services (pdf) listed in the Private Insurance Plan section. J-1 Scholars - only Plan J meets your immigration requirements. When you are choosing your policy type in your Member Access Portal, please choose plan J. If you choose a different plan, then you will need to buy additional insurance that meets all US Department of State health insurance requirements.

    "text": "How to find a Primary Care Provider Important: if you are KU student or KU visiting scholar, then you will have health insurance through United Healthcare and you should use Watkins Health Center as the first place you see a doctor for non-emergency visits. A primary care provider may be called a family doctor, a general practitioner, an internal medicine specialist, or something else. Your primary care provider will get to know you over time and become familiar with your medical history and health needs. The Role of Your Primary Care Provider Helps you prevent health problems Teaches you how to improve your overall health Helps you get care when you need it Don\u2019t wait until you are sick to find a primary care provider Find out from your insurance company which primary care providers in your area take your insurance.\u00a0 Then, check with the provider you chose to find out if he or she is seeing new patients (some providers already have a full schedule and will not accept new patients). Make an Appointment with Your Primary Care Provider Click to expand It is a good idea to make an appointment with your new primary care provider even if you are not sick. This visit is sometimes called a \u201cwell visit.\u201d Having a well visit with a new primary care provider will make it easier to get an appointment with that provider when you are sick.\u00a0 At this visit, the provider will ask questions about your medical history, do a routine check-up, screen for health problems, and give you any immunizations you need to help you stay healthy. Your primary care provider may also need to draw your blood or do other tests. Your provider should know which laboratory accepts your insurance, but if you are not sure, call your health insurance company to check. Have This Information with You When You Call for an Appointment Click to expand Is the provider taking new patients? Does the provider accept your insurance, and is he or she in your plan\u2019s network? \u00a0This is important because some providers will accept your insurance, but they will charge you a lot more if they are not in your plan\u2019s network. How much will you pay for the visit? How will you be billed for the services, and what are your options for paying? Does the provider have appointments during hours that are convenient for you, such as on evenings or weekends? When is the next open appointment? Does the provider offer services in your preferred language? Will an interpreter be provided for you if your preferred spoken language is not English? If needed, does the provider have an office, facilities, and medical equipment that are physically accessible for people with disabilities? What information will you need to bring with you when you go to your appointment? \u00a0For example, will you need to bring forms you filled out that were sent by mail or email before the visit? Will you need to bring your medical records or a list of the medicines you take? What is the provider\u2019s cancelation policy? Will you be charged if you are late or miss an appointment? If you need to reschedule an appointment, how long before your appointment do you need to call to avoid being charged? Get Information about Free Preventive Services Click to expand All health plans that are sold in the health insurance marketplaces must cover certain preventive services for free when you use providers that accept your insurance. Preventive care includes, but is not limited to, services such as checking your blood pressure, testing your cholesterol level, screening for depression and diabetes, giving immunizations, doing mammograms, providing well-woman care, and counseling about weight issues. Get more information about these free preventive services by contacting your health plan. You can find a customer service number for your health plan on your insurance card and on billing statements or other documents from your health insurance company. Know When to Use Emergency Care Click to expand When you are sick or injured, you need to know how to get the care you need quickly. Many primary care providers offer same-day appointments or have a provider who is on call for urgent care. Seeing your regular provider is generally much cheaper than visiting an emergency room. Hospital emergency rooms provide fast, life-saving care and are open 24 hours a day, seven days a week. If you go to a hospital emergency room when it\u2019s not a life-or-death situation, it may cost more money, and you may have a longer wait than if you go to your primary care provider. In most situations, when you are sick, you will save time and money by seeing your primary care provider. But in a true emergency, go to the emergency room. Be sure to find out which hospitals in your area are in your new insurance plan\u2019s network so that if you need emergency care, you know which hospitals to go to.

Help Center \u2013 United Healthcare Student Resources I am an international student at KU. Do I need to have health insurance? Yes. Health insurance is mandatory for all international students in F-1, F-2 and J-1 status enrolled at KU. There are no exceptions. I am a permanent resident/US citizen and not an international student. Do I need to have health insurance? No. Although you are advised to have health insurance, ISS does not enforce this requirement on permanent residents. If you are a permanent resident or U.S. citizen but your account is flagged with an insurance indicator (ISI), your visa type citizenship information will need to be updated in SAKU academic database. For information on how to change your visa type citizenship information in SAKU email issinsurance@ku.edu . Do I need to purchase the United Healthcare plan offered by the ISS office? No. You are free to purchase any insurance as long as it meets the minimum requirements. Waivers will not be granted if the policy does not meet all the requirements, no exceptions! How do I enroll in the United Healthcare insurance plan? In order to purchase the United Healthcare insurance, you must be an international student currently enrolled at KU. As an F-1, F-2 or J-1 student the insurance charge will be automatically added to your tuition bill and will appear as a required student fee. If for some reason you do not see this charge or have questions, please contact an insurance team member. I already have an insurance plan with a different company. How do I get waived from the insurance requirements? Please see our waiver section for instructions on how to submit your alternate insurance. I am a sponsored student and my sponsor pays for my insurance. How do I get waived from the insurance requirements? Please see our waiver section for instructions on how to submit your alternate insurance. I am currently holding a work visa (i.e. H, TN, L). How do I get waived from the insurance requirements? Only students enrolled in KU classes with an F-1, F-2, J-1 or J-2 immigration status are required to submit an insurance waiver for their alternate insurance. I applied for an insurance waiver, but there is still a charge of $187 from ISS on my account. Why? The $187 ISS fee ($93.50 for summer) is not related to the mandatory insurance requirement. Questions regarding the fee should be directed to our Office Manager, Regina Sherrill . I already paid the insurance premium. When will I receive my ID card? Your Student Health Insurance ID Card is available online 24/7 via My Account on the United Healthcare website. Please keep in mind insurance ID cards are only available after you have received notification from ISS Insurance that your insurance for the semester has been activated.

Use your login (or create a new login) on the United Healthcare website and request a new ID card through the members options. If you need to utilize services before you receive it, please ask ISS to call Student Assurance Services to verify coverage. When will my insurance expire? Expiration dates are December 31 (for the fall semester), May 31 (for the spring) or July 31 (summer semester). I'm not taking classes this fall or spring semester. Do I have to have insurance? If you are an international student, and you are in the US, you are required to be enrolled in a full course of study each fall/spring semester to stay legal in the country; therefore, health insurance is required. If you are currently on OPT or CPT, please discuss this matter with the insurance coordinator to determine if insurance is required. I am not taking classes this summer. Do I have to have insurance? No, but we strongly recommend that you have insurance all year round to avoid issues caused by breaks in coverage, such as accidents or pre-existing conditions. Students not enrolled in summer classes are still eligible for insurance if they were enrolled in the preceding spring term. I am just taking classes over the summer. Do I still need insurance? Yes. For any semester (fall, spring or summer) in which you are enrolled at the University of Kansas, you are required to have insurance. This may be an insurance of your choice that is approved by the ECI Services, or the United Healthcare plan. I have just purchased the United Healthcare insurance plan. How do I learn about the coverage?

If you plan to live on campus, please work directly with the Department of Student Housing. It is important to make your on-campus living arrangements early because availability may fill up quickly. Apply as early as possible for the best chance to get on-campus housing. NOTE: All on-campus residential hall housing options should be understood to be for the student only; there is no on-campus family housing for students. Housing for Employees This section is for employees who are not enrolling in any classes at KU. Graduate assistants should just visit the Housing Department website. For full-time employees there is some limited transition housing, where you can rent an apartment from Housing for a few months while you search for more permanent housing. Sunflower Apartments Housing for Visiting Scholars There are very few on campus housing options for Visiting Scholars. Your department may contact the Housing Department to see if there any availability, but you should expect to live off campus. Sunflower Apartments Related Content Off Campus Housing",

    "text": "Off Campus Housing Options Many visitors realize is that in Lawrence owning a car makes makes life much easier.\u00a0 However, many visitors will not be here long enough to justify purchasing a car.\u00a0 This means that using public transportation becomes important, and finding a home close to public transportation options equally important.\u00a0 The Lawrence public transportation is designed to bring students to campus. This means Monday - Thursday, buses are very frequent.\u00a0 However on Friday and Saturday, they might not be as frequent and on Sunday there is no bus service. Lawrence Public Transportation Many decide that it is easier to find a home close to amenities or resources (for example: grocery stories, shopping, dinning, etc.) outside of KU so you can walk there and then take the bus to campus during the week. We recommend that you talk with your department / faculty host about good neighborhoods to live in Lawrence.\u00a0 The following are websites (not affiliated with KU) where you can search apartment postings.\u00a0 If possible, take a friend with you when viewing apartments. Lawrence Journal World newspaper This is Lawrence\u2019s local newspaper.\u00a0 Look under the classifieds->Rentals->unfurnished apartments. This is one of the best sources for off-campus housing. Apartment.com website This is a site where you can search for apartments.\u00a0 Remember that most apartments are unfurnished, and utilities such as electricity, gas, cable television and water are often NOT included in rent. Housing Search Strategies Have a cell phone and laptop computer to inquire about vacancies that become available.\u00a0 Many apartment leasing offices do not answer calls and have voicemail or email only.\u00a0 You will need the phone to receive those returned messages.\u00a0 You may want to prepare a script when leaving telephone messages for the landlord, mentioning that you are a new employee or scholar at KU and that you are interested in the property. Rent or borrow a car. Your search will go faster if you drive. Get familiar with housing vocabulary (see following page) Become familiar with names of neighborhoods.\u00a0 Look for housing in a neighborhood near campus where you will be working or studying, or along public transportation lines to make your commute more convenient since parking is difficult to find. Walk or drive around neighborhoods you like and look for \u201cFor Rent / For Lease\u201d signs posted in the window or front yard of houses and apartments. Drive/ walk by to see the places you are interested in to find out what the exterior and neighborhood look like before making an appointment for viewing.\u00a0 When you find something you like, do not hesitate to let the landlord know immediately that you are interested.\u00a0 Have a check or money order ready to pay the deposit. Prepare a list of questions to ask your potential landlord. What utilities are included in the rent (water, gas, electricity, garbage, cable, and/or internet)? What is the cost of gas and electricity per month? When will the apartment be available (when is the first day I can move in)? How much is the security deposit? What parking is available? Are laundry facilities located on site? Meet potential roommates in person before making a commitment.\u00a0 Do not make arrangements from abroad to find a roommate. You would not want to move in with someone that might not be suitable for you. Do not be surprised if you are asked for an interview yourself from everyone in the house. Most apartments are unfurnished. You can purchase large furniture items (bed, dresser, tables, chairs, etc.) and have them delivered (for a fee).\u00a0 This is very often cheaper than renting a car to pick up items, and you can schedule when they will be delivered.",

    "text": "Identity Theft What is Identity Theft Identity theft happens when someone steals your personal information and uses it without your permission.\u00a0 It is a serious crime that can wreck your finances, credit history, and reputation - and it can take time, money and patience to resolve.\u00a0 The Federal Trade Commission (FTC), the nation's consumer protection agency, prepared a guide to help you repair the damage identity theft can cause and reduce the risk of identity theft happening to you. Protecting your Personal Identity: 5 Useful Tips Be careful about giving your personal information to a person, agency or company that contacts you (as opposed to one you contact).\u00a0 Never give out your Social Security Number, date of birth, mother's maiden name, credit card number, bank PIN codes or passwords. Ask the person to give you a phone number you can call to verify his/her identity and ask the person to send you any information they would like you to consider in writing. Do not give your personal information to anyone, unless you know who you are giving it to and why they need the information. Keep your important papers secure, shred documents with sensitive information before you put them in the trash, and limit the personal information you carry with you in your wallet, purse or bag. Pick up your mail daily to minimize the risk of it being stolen. Place outgoing mail in a US Postal Service mail receptacle rather than your own mailbox. Maintain appropriate security on your computers and other electronic devices. Never give out personal information unless you are using a secure website. You may determine if a website is secure by looking at the beginning of the web address in your browser's address bar. It should read \"https://\" instead of \"http://\". You may also look to the bottom right of your screen for a padlock symbol. How to Know if Your Identity is Stolen You see unexplained withdrawals from your bank account. You don't get your bills or other mail. Merchants refuse your checks. Debt collectors call about debts that aren't yours. You find unfamiliar accounts or charges on your credit report. Medical providers bill you for services you didn't use. Your health plan rejects your legitimate medical claim because the records show you've reached your benefit limit. The Internal Revenue Service (IRS) notifies you that more than one tax return was filed in your name, or that you have income from an employer you don't work for. You get notices that your information was compromised by a data breach at a company where you do business or have an account. You are arrested for a crime someone else allegedly committed in your name. Steps to Take if Identity is Stolen If your wallet, Social Security card, or other personal, financial, or account information is lost or stolen contact the credit reporting companies and place a fraud alert on your credit file. Learn how to place a fraud alert on your file Check your bank and other statements for unusual activity.\u00a0 You may want to take additional steps, depending on what information was lost or stolen.\u00a0 For example, you can exercise your legal right to a free copy of your credit report. If your information is lost in a data breach, the organization that lost your information will notify you and tell you about your rights.\u00a0 Generally, you may choose to place a fraud alert on your credit file, monitor your accounts for unusual activity, and exercise your right to a free copy of your credit report. You may have other rights under state law.",

Imposters are individuals who pretend to be someone else (often a government agency or official) in order to obtain personal information or money. Scammers often target international students and scholars. If you get a phone call, text or email from someone claiming to be law enforcement (police, FBI, etc.), Immigration agent (ICE, DHS, USCIS, etc.), IRS (taxes), or any other U.S. or foreign government agency, contact be suspicious.

LSS is completely confidential and free to KU students. Contact: Legal Service for Students website or 785-864-5665 Recognizing Scams: If you receive a phone call and the caller threatens you with arrest in order for you to comply with their demands, this is likely a scam. If you receive a phone call or email demanding money, this is likely a scam. Scammers often request cash, gift cards, wire transfers, venmo, etc. because these methods are harder to trace. If you receive a phone call and the caller tells you that you can't tell anyone about your situation (your friends, family or university) because you are \"under investigation\", this is likely a scam. If the websites, emails or other text provided by an individual asking for money contain misspellings and grammatical errors, this is likely a scam.

Many people offer help with immigration services.\u00a0 Unfortunately, not all are authorized to do so, and the wrong help can hurt you.\u00a0 Sometimes people are just trying to get your personal information.\u00a0 This is illegal and may be considered an immigration service scam.

May I drop a course? Will that affect my scholarship? As long as you are maintaining your required enrollment for your scholarship, dropping a course will not affect your scholarship. However, there may be enrollment requirements for academic or immigration purposes, please also connect with your academic advisor and with ISS regarding your enrollment questions. Can my scholarship be combined with other financial aid or external scholarships? Your scholarship can be combined with external scholarships and with most financial aid.

    "text": "Taxes in the United States The United States tax system may seem confusing to international visitors.\u00a0 Many people in the United States pay licensed tax preparers or attorneys to interpret tax laws, forms and filing requirements.\u00a0 While International Support Services is not legally allowed to give individual tax advice, this general information should answer some of your basic questions. Specific questions regarding your taxes should be addressed to KU Legal Services for Students .\u00a0 If you have questions about tax treaties or think your tax withholding is incorrect, please contact the KU Payroll Office . Tax Workshops Every year about 6 weeks prior to the deadline for filing your taxes with the US government, Legal Services for Students will hold tax workshops. They are a fantastic resource and we strongly suggest you attend a workshop if this is your first year filing taxes. These workshops are for international students, international visiting scholars and international employees. Filing Tax Requirements Many International student/scholars/employees who have been in the United States must file (submit) an annual tax return by the following year\u2019s tax filing deadline, April 15.\u00a0 Income that is taxed includes wages, scholarships, and earnings on investments.\u00a0 International scholars must file a tax return even if the scholar did not work in the United States. In the spring semester, the University of Kansas provides tax assistance software, GLACIER, to help international students, scholars and employees submit tax returns.\u00a0 The International Support Services\u00a0will email you this information during February/March. Tax Withholding and the W-4 Form When a person is working in the United States, the employer is required to deduct a portion of the salary in each pay period which contributes to income taxes.\u00a0 At the start of your employment, you will complete a W-4 Form (Employees Withholding Allowance Certificate). The information on the form determines how much will be withheld from your paycheck for taxes.\u00a0 Your employer should be able to help you complete the W-4 Form if you have any questions.\u00a0 KU employees can contact the Payroll Office with specific questions. Basic Information In the United States, tax law divides people into resident alien and non-resident alien for tax purposes.\u00a0 Your tax status can be determined by the Substantial Presence Test (SPT).\u00a0 There are different rules for submitting taxes based on whether you are resident alien or non-resident alien.\u00a0 This status is your tax status and is not the same as your immigration status. Non-Residents Aliens for Tax Purposes You are required to fill out a mail-in Internal Revenue Service (IRS) Form 8843 \u201cStatement for Exempt Individuals and Individuals with a Medical Condition\u201d if you were in the United States for any part of the calendar year.\u00a0 This is true even if you had no income from the United States (U.S. source income). If you received any U.S. source income during the calendar year, you may have to fill out and mail in IRS Form 1040NR or Form 1040NR-EZ in addition to Form 8843, depending on the kind and amount of U.S. source income you received. Resident Aliens for Tax Purposes Resident aliens for tax purposes follow the same guidelines and use the same forms as United States citizens. You should first determine your filing status by reading IRS Publications: Filing Status and then determine whether you are required to file a federal income tax form. You may not be required to file any tax forms at all if your gross income is below the threshold found in IRS Publication 501: Filing Requirements Chart for Most Taxpayers . If you are required to file a federal tax form, information about which form to file is at IRS Publication 17 . Tax Treaties Some countries have tax treaty agreements with the United States in which certain types of income may be exempted from federal tax.\u00a0 General information on tax treaty benefits can be found in IRS Publication 901.\u00a0 If you are a KU employee, you may wish to discuss possible tax treaty with your Payroll Office representative when you begin employment.

    "text": "Cars Purchasing a Car It can be helpful to ask an American friend to assist you in buying a car, because they might be more familiar with buying practices in the United States. You can do some research first to learn about average prices and reliability by consulting the Kelley Blue Book and Consumer Reports . You should test drive the car before you buy it, and you should have an auto mechanic examine the car. There will be a fee for this, but it could prevent you from paying for expensive repairs later. When you buy the vehicle, the seller must sign the title in the presence of a notary. The title is the official document which states that you are the owner of the car. It will be changed to your name when you register the car. Do not pay for the car until the title is signed over to you by the owner. Vehicle Insurance You are required by law to have automobile liability insurance. You must have insurance to own and operate a car, and you have to keep the card you will get from the insurance company in your car. You must be able to show proof of insurance if you are stopped by the police. The cost depends on many factors, and you should contact several insurance companies to look for the best rate. Registration and License Plate Registering and licensing are done at the Douglas County Courthouse at 11th and Massachusetts Street. To purchase license plates (also called \u201ctags\u201d), you will need to have the car title and proof of insurance. If you bought the car from a dealer and paid the sales tax, you will need proof of that also. The cost of the tags will depend on the weight of the car and can vary from $15 to $35. You may also have to pay sales tax and Kansas registration tax. The tag must be renewed every year and you will have to pay property tax on the car when you renew the tag. That amount depends on the value of your car. Maintenance and Repairs Be sure to check your oil and coolant regularly. Look in the yellow pages under \u201cAutomobile Repairing and Service\u201d to find a place to get your car checked or repaired, or ask friends for a recommendation. Before agreeing to any repairs, it\u2019s a good idea to get a written estimate of the cost. Never tell a mechanic to just fix everything that is wrong. You could pay more than the car is worth. Car Accidents If you are involved in a car accident, do not move your car. Call 911 and wait for the police to arrive. Be sure to get the name and address of the other driver, their driver's license number and the name of their insurance company. The other driver will want to get this information from you also. Contact your insurance company as soon as possible after the accident.\u00a0 Additional resources: If you have any questions, the Consumer Affairs office (819 Vermont, 843-4608) can be of help. They have information on buying a vehicle. You can also consult them with complaints about specific businesses or companies. Car Buying Tips Please remember that these tips are general advice.\u00a0 Your car buying experience might be different. Tip: Your best bet will be a franchise dealer that specializes in the brand you are buying, preferable Certified Pre-Owned. Tip: Do not go to a dealership without having an idea of what you want to buy.\u00a0 Browse online at Autotrader to find cars and prices.\u00a0 Most of the time dealerships have their used cars on this website as well. Tip: Only look at cars that are within your budget.\u00a0 Do not hope to negotiate a lower price before even looking at the car. Tip: Test drive the car.\u00a0 Drive the car you are considering buying, make sure that there are no warning lights, everything works, and it drives well. Where to buy a used car: privately vs. franchise dealer Click to expand A private seller is a gamble.\u00a0 It could be a nice car that the owner is trying to maximize the value by selling it themselves instead of trading it at the dealer.\u00a0 Or it could be defective and they are trying to get rid of it because it might fall apart at the next light. If it sounds too good to be true, it probably is. Once you decide on the model and brand of the car, browse online listings. Pre-purchase inspection Click to expand It is common advice to have any used car pre-purchase inspected by an independent mechanic.\u00a0 Ask your friends and colleagues to find a recommended mechanic. A basic pre-purchase inspection will cost $100 to $200.\u00a0 For this price range, you can expect a good overall mechanical inspection, including a test drive, of the vehicle. Many people use the website Carfax to check the vehicle history report. You need to know the VIN to pay for a report. If the car is still under warranty or is certified, an inspection can be overkill, and the only thing you can get out of it is to find out whether the car has been in an accident.\u00a0 If a used car has a warranty and has any major mechanical issues, it will be fixed under the warranty.\u00a0 Don\u2019t be surprised if a dealership refuses to let you pre-purchase inspect a car that has a warranty. What to do at the dealership Click to expand If you are ready to visit the dealership, you should already have the exact car you want to buy in mind.\u00a0 Your goal is to make sure that the car is actually still there, that it is ready and not still going through service or body work and to make a solid appointment with a specific sales person.\u00a0 Confirm your appointment the day before. Take a friend with you in order to have someone else assessing the situation. When you arrive for your appointment, check that you are looking at the actual car you saw online.\u00a0 The VIN number will match.\u00a0 Make sure it has the advertised options; websites and software make mistakes.\u00a0 It is your responsibility to check before purchasing. Negotiate Click to expand Once you know what car you like/ can afford, email the dealerships in your area that have the car.\u00a0 Remember that information about car prices and locations can be found on Autotrader .\u00a0 Ask for a response in which they explicitly state the \u201cout the door\u201d price.\u00a0 This \u201cout the door\u201d price includes all fees in the price they are giving you. Since you have emailed several dealerships and received written prices, now you can negotiate a better price.\u00a0 People usually pick the best three and let them know you have a better offer.\u00a0 Continue to negotiate until they tell you that they can\u2019t go any lower.\u00a0 Usually the top three prices will be very similar, within a few hundred dollars.\u00a0 At this point you know exactly how much your monthly payment will be and the cost of your insurance.\u00a0 Make sure the terms of the sale is exactly as you expect.\u00a0 There should be no surprises.\u00a0 If you are surprised about a fee or the price, negotiate or walk away and contact the second dealership.",

    "text": "Troubleshooting iHawk Login Issues (for Students) An issue may affect users with certain browser settings when they try to log into iHawk. Typically, the user enters their KU online ID and password on the iHawk Login page but the Login page either simply reloads with blank fields or the user gets an error message despite entering correct login credentials. To resolve this issue, please try the following: Clear all the cookies/cache/history/saved iHawk passwords in the browser you are using to access iHawk and also make sure the browser is configured to accept cookies.\u00a0(This should be a browser that you don't use regularly to log into other websites with saved login credentials. If you need help on clearing your browser cookies/cache/history/saved iHawk passwords, you can get in touch with the IT Customer Service Center (785) 864-8080 and they can walk you through it.) Close the browser, reopen the iHawk page and try logging in again using the blue login button. NOTE: To eliminate the browser\u00a0history as a factor without clearing it in your settings, you can try opening a new private / incognito window in any browser, then go to the iHawk page, click on the blue LOGIN button, and type in your KU online ID and password. If you get an error, please send the error ID or a screenshot of the error page to ihawk-help@ku.edu . If you are able to log into iHawk this way, it means that you need to clear more of your browser history to be able to log in when not using a private browsing / incognito window. In this case, you may want to use a browser that you don't use regularly and set it up to clear all history on exit; then it will work with iHawk. Recommended Practices Finally,\u00a0in order to\u00a0reduce the\u00a0likelihood of similar issues affecting you in the future when working with iHawk, we recommend the following practices: Always log out of the iHawk system after you are done working. Configure\u00a0the browser to automatically clear cookies/cache/history upon closing. Other Common iHawk Login Issues If the cookies/cache/saved passwords are cleared, or if you used a private browsing / incognito window, but you are still getting an error, it might be that your password has expired. This normally happens when the password has not been changed in more than 7 months. To resolve this issue, please reset your password and try to access iHawk again. If you forgot your password, try to reset it by answering your challenge questions or using your recovery e-mail. If you have trouble resetting your password [say, because you forgot answers to your challenge questions, or you don't have any recovery options set up, or your account is locked, etc.],\u00a0you should get in touch with IT Customer Support Center\u00a0as only they are able to help you in that case. Their contact information is as follows: 785-864-8080 itcsc@ku.edu If you are still having trouble logging into iHawk after trying the above steps, please send an email to ihawk-help@ku.edu and include a detailed description of the problem, which of the above troubleshooting tips you followed, and any relevant screenshots.",

    "text": "Incoming Graduate Assistants If you are a new student at KU and have been offered an assistantship (Graduate Teaching Assistantship, Graduate Research Assistantship, Graduate Assistantship, or Fellowship), you must prepare to take extra steps after arrival. Please be aware: You may need to bring an additional $5,000 to help you until your first paycheck, and possibly more if you need to apply for a SSN after arrival.\u00a0This is only a recommendation. However, this will help you cover the cost of securing housing and food, purchasing books, and paying fees until your first paycheck arrives. Pre-Arrival To get paid and enroll for any qualifying benefits (i.e., insurance) for your graduate assistantship work at KU, you will need to complete the HR onboarding requirements. HR Onboarding has an online component which can be started prior to your arrival in the United States.\u00a0 You will receive an invitation to your KU email address from kuhronboarding@ku.edu to begin the online onboarding process.\u00a0 It is very important that you check your KU email account frequently to receive notifications, alerts and other time-sensitive correspondence.\u00a0 A KU Onboarding Center Representative can work with you via KU email to assist with specific onboarding requirements and any additional questions you may have. While most online onboarding tasks can be completed before you arrive, certain forms that require a Social Security Number (SSN)\u00a0and/or visual verification of immigration documents must be finalized after your physical arrival, and in some cases, after you have obtained your SSN. Fall 2025 Arrival ALL graduate students must arrive by August 4th, 2025 If you DO NOT have a Social Security Number (SSN),\u00a0we recommend that you arrive earlier (if possible) to give yourself enough time to apply for an SSN. Please plan finances accordingly . Most check-ins, onboarding, and possible required trainings for your assistantship can be completed only after your arrival in the US (see below). Fall 2025 classes start 08/18/2025. Required Steps to complete in person after arrival International Student Orientation (ISO) Upload required immigration documents\u00a0(including \"Report Your U.S. Arrival\" (Upload I-94 e-form)\u00a0to iHawk and attend\u00a0ISS check-ins\u00a0[immigration document check] Attend Staying Legal presentation\u00a0(F-1 & J-1 only) during orientation Watkins Health Center check-in\u00a0[for immunizations and vaccinations] AEC Proficiency Test\u00a0and/or Speak Test [if applicable] Open a US bank account Complete Onboarding with KU \u2013 online AND in-person I-9 processes Possible\u00a0orientation required by your graduate department\u00a0or as a new GTA, etc. If you do not have a social security number: In-Person SSN application\u00a0at the Lawrence Social Security Administration (SSA). This is only possible after\u00a0requesting SSN Letter and\u00a0completing ISS check-in after arrival. Please see the \"SSN Application Process\" section below for important details.) SSN Application Process (if you do not already have one) If you do not have a Social Security Number (SSN), you must apply for one before you can finalize your onboarding process at KU. It\u00a0can take 1-2 weeks from arrival to obtain an SSN and be put on payroll. Step 1: \u00a0Submit \"Request SSN Letter for On-Campus Jobs (F-1)\" This form can be found on the \u2018ISS Check-in Checklist\u2019 under the \u2018Requests\u2019 section on the home page of iHawk. This form is available and you are encouraged to\u00a0start the process now. Complete the e-form with your information and your Employer Contact information. Your Employer Contact is the person who offered you employment (such as a faculty member or departmental office staff). If you do not know who your employer contact is, ask your department before you fill out this form. If you are a J-1 student (and KU is your program sponsor), submit the \u201cOn-Campus Work Permit Request\u201d e-form instead. You will need this letter in order to apply for the SSN.\u00a0 This letter can be issued only after your arrival to the U.S. and will be provided to you at your scheduled ISS check-in appointment (during orientation). Please be sure to have the e-form completed before your ISS Check-In appointment. Again, this form is available and you are encouraged to\u00a0start the process now. Step 2:\u00a0Finish all required e-forms in iHawk upon arrival to KU Campus Finish uploading all required immigration documents in the \u2018ISS Check-in Checklist\u2019, including \u201cReport Your U.S. Arrival (Upload I-94)\u201d (only possible after entry into the U.S.) and \u201cLocal U.S. Address\u201d e-forms. Step 3: Attend required ISS Check-in ISS Check-in (immigration document check) Date/Location/Time: scheduled during International Student Orientation *Early ISS Check-in opportunity before orientation (OPTIONAL)*: Date: Friday, August 1, 2025 Location: To Be Determined Time: To Be Determined At the required ISS check-in, an ISS immigration advisor will review all of your uploaded immigration documents. Upon review and legal status is confirmed, the ISS advisor will register/validate your SEVIS record (required before applying for an SSN). The ISS advisor will also issue you the requested \u201cF-1 SSN Letter for On-Campus Jobs\u201d (or \u201cOn-campus Work Permit\u201d for J-1s), which you will need in order to apply for the SSN in-person at the Social Security Administration (SSA) office. The ISS advisor will also provide you with detailed instructions on how to apply for the SSN. Step 4: Complete online SSN application and visit the SSA office in-person to apply Follow the specific instructions provided to you at the ISS Check-in. You will be instructed to start the SSN application online and then visit the Social Security Administration office in Lawrence with your original immigration documents and online SSN application reference number. If you skip this final step and DO NOT go to the SSA office in-person with your original immigration documents to finalize the SSA application, you will NOT be issued an SSN and therefore not put on payroll for on-campus employment.

Important : If KU\u00a0ISS\u00a0(or your program sponsor) has not approved the\u00a0RCL\u00a0by the deadline or prior to dropping below full time, you will be considered in violation of your legal status. A Reduced Course Load (RCL) is a permission from an ISS Advisor to be below the minimum enrollment requirements for a given semester.\u00a0 Federal regulations provide limited circumstances when a J-1 student may be authorized for an RCL.\u00a0 These include medical reasons, bona fide academic reasons, and completion of studies during the final term.\u00a0 Each RCL request requires a review by an ISS advisor before it is approved; approval is granted on a semester basis. Eligibility The following information ONLY applies to J-1 students whose DS-2019 is issued by KU (check item 2 \u201cProgram Sponsor\u201d on your DS-2019).\u00a0 If your DS-2019 is not issued by KU, contact your program sponsor.

For a Medical RCL, you will need medical documentation to submit with your E-Form request. For an Academic/Final Term RCL, meet with your academic dean or advisor before submitting the E-Form.\u00a0 You will need to provide the name and email address of the academic dean/advisor in your E-Form request. Step 2 Log into iHawk and complete the appropriate form (Medical or Academic/Final Term) under J-1 Student Services -->\u00a0 Reduced Course Load. Wait until you receive an e-mail notification instructing you to visit with an ISS immigration advisor. Step 3 Meet with an ISS immigration advisor during DROP-IN ADVISING to review and process your request. Visit the ISS website for the Drop-In Advising schedule. If necessary, drop the course(s), however, this should be done only after getting permission from ISS.

    "text": "About your visa What is a Visa A U.S. visa is an entry document. You can apply for an entry visa only at a U.S. embassy or consulate outside the United States. It is placed on a page in your passport\u00a0and certifies that the consular officer has found you eligible to apply for admission at a U.S. port of entry in a particular classification, such as F-1 student, J-1 research scholar, or H-1B assistant professor. The CBP (Customs and Border Protection) officer makes the final decision on whether you are eligible to enter the U.S. with the visa\u00a0and determines the length of time you may stay. Things to Know About a U.S. Visa Length of Stay Click to expand The visa expiration date is the date until which you can re-enter the U.S. in the same classification with valid, unexpired supporting documents. The period of time you may remain in the U.S. is connected to the end of an academic program, or an authorized period of research or employment. Your visa may expire while you\u2019re in the U.S. If your visa expires while you are in the U.S. it has no effect whatsoever on your status.\u00a0However, if your visa is expired when you leave the U.S. to travel abroad, you will need to renew your visa at a U.S. consulate or embassy to return in the same status. Length of Visa Validity Click to expand The length of a visa's validity is based on reciprocity agreements between your country and the United States. The reciprocity agreements address both the duration and\u00a0the number of entries that are allowed.\u00a0A consular officer, after review of an individual\u2019s visa application, has discretion in the application of the reciprocity agreement. What to know more? Learn about the reciprocity agreements . Lost Passport Click to expand After you have your passport replaced, you can apply for a new visa only at a U.S. consulate or embassy abroad. Use Correct Visa Click to expand If you have visited the U.S. for different purposes, you may have more than one visa in your passport. However, you can have only one status while you are in the United States.\u00a0The visa which is used for your admission to the U.S. becomes the status you will hold. What is Status? One of the most common sources of confusion is the difference between your visa and your status. Your visa is an entry document. When you present your passport, visa and supporting documents at a U.S. port of entry, you are admitted in a non-immigrant status that matches the classification of the visa in your passport. This is also referred to as \"immigration status\" or \u201cvisa status\u201d. The status in which you are admitted by a Customs and Border Protection (CBP) Officer is stamped in your passport and generates an electronic I-94 Arrival Record . You may also obtain a new status in the U.S. through approval of a change of status application by USCIS. Once you have obtained your status, you need to be aware of what you need to do---and not do-- to maintain your legal non-immigrant status as a student, employee or visiting scholar.
