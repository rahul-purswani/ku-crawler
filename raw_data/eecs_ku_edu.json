Electrical engineers can find professional opportunities in a multitude of environments. The telecommunications, computer, and power industries are obvious examples, but other industries using technology seek the expertise of electrical engineers for developing microelectronic integrated circuits, electrical and electronic consumer products, electrical power generation and distribution, industrial instrumentation and control systems, and radar. Computer engineers focus on all aspects of computational devices and systems, including both hardware and software. In addition to the computer system aspects of the electrical engineering and computer science areas listed, computer engineers may work in the areas of computer elements and architectures, very large scale integrated (VLSI) circuits for data processing and storage, embedded and real-time computer systems, or computer networking. Computer engineering graduates can expect to find jobs in digital hardware design, software engineering, and the integration of hardware and software in developing microprocessors, personal computers, workstations, mainframe computers, embedded systems, and computer communication networks.\u00a0 The demand for engineers to design and implement a wide variety of sophisticated computing systems will likely continue to rise. Computer scientists focus on the theory and practice of computing.\u00a0 They may pursue the design, analysis, and implementation of computer algorithms, study the theory of programming methods and languages, or design and develop new programming languages and software systems.\u00a0 Computer scientists may also work in the areas of artificial intelligence, database systems, parallel and distributed computation, human-computer interaction, computer graphics, operating systems, or computer systems analysis. Computer science graduates find jobs in many different industrial and governmental settings. The need for software system design, development, and maintenance is not restricted to those companies whose main business is software development. Virtually every major company and governmental agency has found the need to develop and maintain specialized software for specific purposes. This trend is sure to continue in the future. Interdisciplinary computing couples a very strong computer science component with a thorough background in one of five concentrations: astronomy, biology, chemistry, geography, or physics.\u00a0 Graduates will apply their computing expertise to a variety of large-scale problems of scientific importance. Interdisciplinary computing professionals are likely to collaborate with scientists or other professionals in industrial, government, or academic laboratories.\u00a0 The ever-increasing computational sophistication of scientific studies demands professionals who have computing expertise in addition to scientific training, which is exactly what Interdisciplinary Computing provides. The IT program focuses on technology, managerial, and administrative sides of information technology and its curriculum offers courses in computer information security, systems administration, Web systems and technologies, information security management, software development, computer networks, database design, human-computer interaction, project management, system architecture and integration, operating systems, social and professional issues in IT, and network security. Career opportunities for graduates with electrical engineering, computer engineering, computer science, interdisciplinary computing, and IT degrees are available in many areas of specialization, in many industrial, commercial, academic, and government environments, and in many geographic locations in this country and abroad.\u00a0 Expertise in any of these areas is of vital importance to any high technology organization.\u00a0 In addition, a Bachelor of Science degree in one of these areas prepares a student for continued technical studies at the graduate level or in other professional schools such as medicine or law.",

All Master's degree programs are intended to take between one to two years to complete. The coursework-only M.Eng. is a new degree program that will be offered starting Summer 2022. Explore: Early Admission\u00a0-\u00a0Fast Track Master's of Science (M.S.) Degree Programs The Electrical Engineering and Computer Science (EECS) Department at the University of Kansas offers three Master's degree programs. The M.S. in Information Technology (MSIT) degree program has transitioned out of EECS and the School of Engineering to the School of Professional Studies at the Edwards campus . To view the degree requirements for any of the Master's of Science degrees offered select the associated discipline below. Computer Science Click to expand Advising Early in the program a student must choose an adviser (upon admission, the EECS graduate director serves as the student's initial graduate advisor; however, the student may choose another EECS faculty as adviser based on his/her own academic/research interests). The advisor must be a tenured or tenure track member of the EECS graduate faculty. Meet regularly with adviser to refine plan of study to meet academic and research goals Submit signed enrollment planning (pdf) form or send an email with course enrollment request to have advising hold released each semester Advising holds will be released after the plan of study is approved and a signed enrollment planning (pdf) form is submitted to the EECS Graduate Office. Students should plan their schedules with the understanding that some EECS graduate courses are offered on a two-year rotation. Some classes are offered every semester, others once per year, and some advanced courses are offered once every four semesters. Check with the University Registrar for a complete listing of courses. Plan of Study Every MS student is required to have a goal for their MS program that matches the desired degree. The plan of study must be consistent with the identified degree and goals. The plan of study outlines all course work and designates the thesis or non-thesis option. When creating the plan of study, the student should: Work with adviser to form a committee and to decide what classes best meet your academic goals. Submit plan of study before the second semester of graduate study. Update plan of study when modifications are made and resubmit plan for approval. The plan of study must adhere to the following rules: Minimum of 5 EECS courses numbered 700 or higher, excluding Directed Graduate Reading (EECS 801), Graduate Problems (EECS 891), Master's Thesis (EECS 899) and Post-Master's Research (EECS 998). Maximum of 3 hours outside the department Include at least one semester of EECS Colloquium (EECS 802), to be taken the first semester of the program.

The Qual demonstrates the ability of the student to understand and apply fundamental concepts and evaluates their potential to pursue doctoral research. The EECS Qual completes the Ph.D. Research Skills Requirement for Doctoral students at KU. A student becomes eligible to take the qualifying exam after both: (a) completing 24 hours of graduate coursework, and (b) being formally accepted into the PhD program. The student must also complete 6 hours of KU graduate coursework before taking the exam. The EECS Qual uses four types of evidence to evaluate the PhD student. Advisor recommendation \u2013 the student\u2019s advisor will provide a frank but confidential assessment of the student\u2019s ability to conduct PhD-level scholarship. Academic performance \u2013 the KU classroom performance of the student will be assessed. Research ability \u2013 each student will submit written evidence of their research ability. Oral exam \u2013 A committee of 3 faculty members will interview the student, discussing and probing topics associated with items 2 and 3 above. A PhD student application for the Qual includes an \u201cAbstract of Research Interests\u201d, which provides a description and overview of the student\u2019s interests and anticipated research direction. The main purpose of the abstract is to introduce the oral exam committee to the scholarly interests of the student, such that conversations and questions during the exam are fairly and effectively aligned with these interests.\u00a0A secondary purpose of the abstract is to provide evidence as to the student\u2019s ability to write effectively, and to communicate clearly and unambiguously technical content and ideas. As such, this abstract must be written and edited entirely by the student. The prose must therefore be original\u2014it cannot be copied from a published document. A committee of 3 faculty members appointed by the department will conduct an oral exam of the PhD student.\u00a0The committee will receive the student\u2019s research statement and course transcripts prior to this oral interview. Two hours will be scheduled for this interview. Using the student\u2019s KU transcript, research statement, and the oral exam, the student\u2019s exam committee will make a pass/fail recommendation. The department\u2019s qualifying exam committee will then review both the advisor\u2019s and the exam committee\u2019s recommendations and\u00a0render a grade for the exam. Students who fail the exam are allowed to retake it one more time between 6 to 12 months after receiving a failing grade. If they fail it a second time, they will not be allowed to continue in the doctoral program. Explore: Qualifying Exam Topics Application Form (pdf) Ph.D. Activity Report Students are required to submit an annual Ph.D. Activity Report (PHAR), which is used to assess academic progress. A student who receives a second unsatisfactory evaluation will be placed on academic probation. Academic probation will be removed upon substantial progress as documented in the student's next PHAR; without substantial progress toward the degree, the student's Ph.D. status will be terminated. Comprehensive Examination After completing at least three-fourths of the course work requirements, students must pass the comprehensive examination. Before the exam, they will submit a detailed proposal for a possible dissertation. The doctoral committee will conduct an oral examination that evaluates a candidate\u2019s proposal and overall knowledge of Computer Science. If the student passes the comprehensive examination and later chooses a substantially different dissertation topic, a new proposal must be presented for the approval of the doctoral committee. At least three weeks before the intended Ph.D. comprehensive exam, a student must do the following: Verify your plan of study is complete, correct, and on file in the EECS Graduate Office Schedule a time and location for defense with committee members and coordinate with staff to reserve the room Email date, time, location, full committee, title and short abstract (< 350 words) to the EECS Graduate Office Distribute a written Ph.D. dissertation proposal to your committee Prepare and practice comprehensive presentation Doctoral Dissertation and Final Oral Examination A minimum of 1 month after completing your comprehensive exam and at least three weeks prior to your doctoral defense: Check with faculty advisor, the EECS Graduate Office, and the Engineering Dean's office to ensure all degree requirements have been completed and your dissertation meets University specifications Verify your plan of study is complete, correct, and on file in the EECS Graduate Office Schedule a time and location for defense with committee members and coordinate with staff to reserve the room Email date, time, location, full committee, title and short abstract (less than 350 words) to the EECS Graduate Office Distribute a written Ph.D. dissertation proposal to your committee Prepare and practice dissertation presentation >After your doctoral defense, you must do the following: >Make final corrections to your dissertation as directed by your committee Get the title page and acceptance pages signed by all committee members Deliver the signed pages to the Engineering Dean's office Submit signed Doctoral Checklist (pdf) and Graduation Report to Engineering Dean\u2019s office Submit Dissertation Online Deliver bound copies to committee members (if requested).

Fatima Al-Shaikhli Optical Fiber Measurements: Leveraging Coherent FMCW Techniques When & Where: Monday, April 28, 2025 - 2:00 PM Nichols Hall, Room 246 (Executive Conference Room) Committee Members: Rongqing Hui, Chair Shannon Blunt Shima Fardad Alessandro Salandrino Judy Wu Abstract Recent advancements in optical fiber technology have proven to be invaluable in a variety of fields, extending far beyond high-speed communications. These innovations enable optical fiber sensing, which plays a critical role across diverse applications, from medical diagnostics to infrastructure monitoring and automotive systems. This research focuses on leveraging commercially available coherent optical transceiver systems to develop novel measurement techniques for characterizing optical fiber properties. Specifically, our goal is to leverage a digitally chirped frequency-modulated continuous wave (FMCW) to extract detailed information about optical fiber characteristics, as well as target range. Through this approach, we aim to enable more accurate and fast assessments of fiber performance and integrity, while exploring the potential for utilizing existing optical communication networks to enhance fiber characterization capabilities. This goal is investigated through three distinct projects: (1) fiber type characterization based on intensity-modulated electrostriction response, (2) self-homodyne coherent Light Detection and Ranging (LiDAR) system for target range and velocity detection, and (3) birefringence measurements using a coherent Polarization-sensitive Optical Frequency Domain Reflectometer (OFDR) system. Electrostriction in an optical fiber is introduced by interaction between the forward propagated optical signal and the acoustic standing waves in the radial direction resonating between the center of the core and the cladding circumference of the fiber. The response of electrostriction is dependent on fiber parameters, especially the mode field radius. We demonstrated a novel technique of identifying fiber types through the measurement of intensity modulation induced electrostriction response. As the spectral envelope of electrostriction induced propagation loss is anti-symmetrical, the signal to noise ratio can be significantly increased by subtracting the measured spectrum from its complex conjugate. We show that if the field distribution of the fiber propagation mode is Gaussian, the envelope of the electrostriction-induced loss spectrum closely follows a Maxwellian distribution whose shape can be specified by a single parameter determined by the mode field radius. We also present a self-homodyne FMCW LiDAR system based on a coherent receiver. By using the same linearly chirped waveform for both the LiDAR signal and the local oscillator, the self-homodyne coherent receiver performs frequency de-chirping directly in the photodiodes, significantly simplifying signal processing. As a result, the required receiver bandwidth is much lower than the chirping bandwidth of the signal. Multi-target detection is demonstrated experimentally, and while only amplitude modulation is required in the LiDAR transmitter, the phase-diversity coherent receiver enables simultaneous detection of both range and velocity for each target, along with the sign of the target\u2019s velocity. In addition, we demonstrate a polarization-sensitive OFDR system utilizing a commercially available digital coherent optical transceiver to generate a linear frequency chirp via carrier-suppressed single-sideband modulation. This method ensures linearity in chirping and phase continuity of the optical carrier. The coherent homodyne receiver, incorporating both polarization and phase diversity, recovers the state of polarization (SOP) of the backscattered optical signal along the fiber, mixing with an identically chirped local oscillator. With a spatial resolution of approximately , a chirping bandwidth, and a measurement time, this system enables precise birefringence measurements. By employing three mutually orthogonal SOPs of the launched optical signal, we can measure birefringence vectors along the fiber, providing not only the magnitude of birefringence but also the direction of any external pressure applied to the fiber. Liangqin Ren Understanding and Mitigating Security Risks towards Trustworthy Deep Learning Systems When & Where: Tuesday, April 22, 2025 - 9:00 AM Nichols Hall, Room 250 (Gemini Room) Committee Members: Fengjun Li, Chair Drew Davidson Bo Luo Zijun Yao Xinmai Yang Abstract Deep learning is widely used in healthcare, finance, and other critical domains, raising concerns about system trustworthiness. However, deep learning models and data still face three types of critical attacks: model theft, identity impersonation, and abuse of AI-generated content (AIGC). To address model theft, homomorphic encryption has been explored for privacy-preserving inference, but it remains highly inefficient. To counter identity impersonation, prior work focuses on detection, disruption, and tracing\u2014yet fails to protect source and target images simultaneously. To prevent AIGC abuse, methods like evaluation, watermarking, and machine unlearning exist, but text-driven image editing remains largely unprotected. This report addresses the above challenges through three key designs. First, to enable privacy-preserving inference while accelerating homomorphic encryption, we propose PrivDNN, which selectively encrypts the most critical model parameters, significantly reducing encrypted operations. We design a selection score to evaluate neuron importance and use a greedy algorithm to iteratively secure the most impactful neurons. Across four models and datasets, PrivDNN reduces encrypted operations by 85%\u201398%, and cuts inference time and memory usage by over 97% while preserving accuracy and privacy. Second, to counter identity impersonation in deepfake face-swapping, where both the source and target can be exploited, we introduce PhantomSeal, which embeds invisible perturbations to encode a hidden\u00a0\u201ccloak\u201d identity. When used as a target, the resulting content displays visible artifacts; when used as a source, the generated deepfake is altered to resemble the cloak identity. Evaluations across two generations of deepfake face-swapping show that PhantomSeal reduces attack success from 97% to 0.8%, with 95% of outputs recognized as the cloak identity, providing robust protection against manipulation. Third, to prevent AIGC abuse, we construct a comprehensive dataset, perform large-scale human evaluation, and establish a benchmark for detecting AI-generated artwork to better understand abuse risks in AI-generated content. Building on this direction, we propose Protecting Copyright against Image Editing (PCIE) to address copyright infringement in text-driven image editing. PCIE embeds an invisible copyright mark into the original image, which transforms into a visible watermark after text-driven editing to automatically reveal ownership upon unauthorized modification. Andrew Stratmann Efficient Index-Based Multi-User Scheduling for Mobile mmWave Networks: Balancing Channel Quality and User Experience When & Where: Monday, April 21, 2025 - 2:00 PM Eaton Hall, Room 2001B Committee Members: Morteza Hashemi, Chair Prasad Kulkarni Erik Perrins Abstract Millimeter Wave (mmWave) communication technologies have the potential to establish high data rates for next-generation wireless networks, as well as enable novel applications that were previously untenable due to high throughput requirements. \u00a0Yet reliable and efficient mmWave communication remains challenged by intermittent link quality due to user mobility and frequent line-of-sight (LoS) blockage, thereby making the links unavailable or more costly to use. \u00a0These factors are further exacerbated in multi-user settings where beam alignment overhead, limited RF chains, and heterogeneous user requirements must be balanced. \u00a0In this work, we present a hybrid multi-user scheduling solution that jointly accounts for mobility-and blockage-induced unavailability to enhance user experience in mmWave video streaming applications. \u00a0Our approach integrates two key components: (i) a blockage-aware scheduling strategy modeled via a Restless Multi-Armed Bandit (RMAB) formulation and prioritized using Whittle Indexing, and (ii) a mobility-aware geometric model that estimates beam alignment overhead cost as a function of receiver motion. \u00a0We develop a comprehensive and efficient index-based scheduler that fuses these models and leverages contextual information, such as receiver distance, mobility history, and queue state, to schedule multiple users in order to maximize throughput. Simulation results demonstrate that our approach reduces system queue backlog and improves fairness compared to round-robin and traditional index-based baselines. Tianxiao Zhang Efficient and Effective Object Detection and Recognition: from Convolutions to Transformers When & Where: Thursday, April 17, 2025 - 9:30 AM Eaton Hall, Room 2001B Committee Members: Bo Luo, Chair Prasad Kulkarni Fengjun Li Cuncong Zhong Guanghui Wang Abstract With the development of Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs), computer vision has entered a new era, significantly enhancing the performance of tasks such as image classification, object detection, segmentation, and recognition. Furthermore, the introduction of Transformer architectures has brought the attention mechanism and a global perspective to computer vision, advancing the field to a new level. The inductive bias inherent in CNNs makes convolutional models particularly well-suited for processing images and videos. On the other hand, the attention mechanism in Transformer models allows them to capture global relationships between tokens. While Transformers often require more data and longer training periods compared to their convolutional counterparts, they have the potential to achieve comparable or even superior performance when the constraints of data availability and training time are mitigated. In this work, we propose more efficient and effective CNNs and Transformers to increase the performance of object detection and recognition. (1) A novel approach is proposed for real-time detection and tracking of small golf balls by combining object detection with the Kalman filter. Several classical object detection models were implemented and compared in terms of detection precision and speed. (2) To address the domain shift problem in object detection, we employ generative adversarial networks (GANs) to generate images from different domains. The original RGB images are concatenated with the corresponding GAN-generated images to form a 6-channel representation, improving model performance across domains. (3) A dynamic strategy for improving label assignment in modern object detection models is proposed. Rather than relying on fixed or statistics-based adaptive thresholds, a dynamic paradigm is introduced to define positive and negative samples. This allows more high-quality samples to be selected as positives, reducing the gap between classification and IoU scores and producing more accurate bounding boxes. (4) An efficient hybrid architecture combining Vision Transformers and convolutional layers is introduced for object recognition, particularly for small datasets. Lightweight depth-wise convolution modules bypass the entire Transformer block to capture local details that the Transformer backbone might overlook. The majority of the computations and parameters remain within the Transformer architecture, resulting in significantly improved performance with minimal overhead. (5) An innovative Multi-Overlapped-Head Self-Attention mechanism is introduced to enhance information exchange between heads in the Multi-Head Self-Attention mechanism of Vision Transformers. By overlapping adjacent heads during self-attention computation, information can flow between heads, leading to further improvements in vision recognition. Faris El-Katri Source Separation using Sparse Bayesian Learning When & Where: Wednesday, April 16, 2025 - 3:00 PM Eaton Hall, Room 2001B Committee Members: Patrick McCormick, Chair Shannon Blunt James Stiles Abstract Wireless communication in recent decades has allowed for a substantial increase in both the speed and capacity of information which may be transmitted over large distances. However, given the expanding societal needs coupled with a finite available spectrum, the question arises of how to increase the efficiency by which information may be transmitted. One natural answer to this question lies in spectrum sharing\u2014that is, in allowing multiple noncooperative agents to inhabit the same spectrum bands. In order to achieve this, we must be able to reliably separate the desired signals from those of other agents in the background. However, since our agents are noncooperative, we must develop a model-agnostic approach at tackling this problem. For this work, we will consider cohabitation between radar signals and communication signals, with the former being the desired signal and the latter being the noncooperative agent. In order to approach such problems involving highly underdetermined linear systems, we propose utilizing Sparse Bayesian Learning and present our results on selected problems. Koyel Pramanick Detect Evidence of Compiler Triggered Security Measures in Binary Code When & Where: Monday, February 24, 2025 - 9:00 AM Eaton Hall, Room 2001B Committee Members: Prasad Kulkarni, Chair Drew Davidson Fengjun Li Bo Luo John Symons Abstract The primary goal of this thesis is to develop and explore techniques to identify security measures added by compilers in software binaries. These measures, added automatically during the build process, include runtime security checks like stack canaries, AddressSanitizer (ASan), and Control Flow Integrity (CFI), which help protect against memory errors, buffer overflows, and control flow attacks. This work also investigates how unresolved compiler warnings, especially those related to security, can be identified in binaries when the source code is unavailable. By studying the patterns and markers left by these compiler features, this thesis provides methods to analyze and verify the security provisions embedded in software binaries. These efforts aim to bridge the gap between compile-time diagnostics and binary-level analysis, offering a way to better understand the security protections applied during software compilation. Ultimately, this work seeks to make software more transparent and give users the tools to independently assess the security measures present in compiled software, fostering greater trust and accountability in software systems. Srinitha Kale AUTOMATING SYMBOL RECOGNITION IN SPOT IT: ADVANCING AI-POWERED DETECTION When & Where: Tuesday, February 4, 2025 - 11:00 AM Eaton Hall, Room 2001B Committee Members: David Johnson, Chair Esam El-Araby Prasad Kulkarni Abstract The \"Spot It!\" game, featuring 55 cards each with 8 unique symbols, presents a complex challenge of identifying a single matching symbol between any two cards. Addressing this challenge, machine learning has been employed to automate symbol recognition, enhancing gameplay and extending applications into areas like pattern recognition and visual search.\u00a0Due to the scarcity of available datasets, a comprehensive collection of 57 distinct Spot It symbols was created, with each class consisting of 1,800 augmented images. These images were manipulated through techniques such as scaling, rotation, and resizing to represent various visual scenarios.\u00a0Then developed a convolutional neural network (CNN) with five convolutional layers, batch normalization, and dropout layers, and employed the Adam optimizer to train model to accurately recognize these symbols. The robust dataset included over 102,600 images, each subject to extensive augmentation to improve the model's ability to generalize across different orientation and scaling conditions. The model was evaluated using 55 scanned \"Spot It!\" cards, where symbols were extracted and preprocessed for prediction. It achieved high accuracy in symbol identification, demonstrating significant resilience to common challenges such as rotations and scaling. This project illustrates the effective integration of data augmentation, deep learning, and computer vision techniques in tackling complex pattern recognition tasks, proving that artificial intelligence can significantly enhance traditional gaming experiences and create new opportunities in various fields. This project delves into the design, implementation, and testing of the CNN, providing a detailed analysis of its performance and highlighting its potential as a transformative tool in image recognition and categorization. Sudha Chandrika Yadlapalli BERT-Driven Sentiment Analysis: Automated Course Feedback Classification and Ratings When & Where: Friday, December 20, 2024 - 11:00 AM Eaton Hall, Room 2001B Committee Members: David Johnson, Chair Prasad Kulkarni Hongyang Sun Abstract Automating the analysis of unstructured textual data, such as student course feedback, is crucial for gaining actionable insights. This project focuses on developing a sentiment analysis system leveraging the DeBERTa-v3-base model, a variant of BERT (Bidirectional Encoder Representations from Transformers), to classify feedback sentiments and generate corresponding ratings on a 1-to-5 scale. A dataset of 100,000+ student reviews was preprocessed and fine-tuned on the model to handle class imbalances and capture contextual nuances. Training was conducted on high-performance A100 GPUs, which enhanced computational efficiency and reduced training times significantly. The trained BERT sentiment model demonstrated superior performance compared to traditional machine learning models, achieving ~82% accuracy in sentiment classification. The model was seamlessly integrated into a functional web application, providing a streamlined approach to evaluate and visualize course reviews dynamically. Key features include a course ratings dashboard, allowing students to view aggregated ratings for each course, and a review submission functionality where new feedback is analyzed for sentiment in real-time. For the department, an admin page provides secure access to detailed analytics, such as the distribution of positive and negative reviews, visualized trends, and the access to view individual course reviews with their corresponding sentiment scores. This project includes a comprehensive pipeline, starting from data preprocessing and model training to deploying an end-to-end application. Traditional machine learning models, such as Logistic Regression and Decision Tree, were initially tested but yielded suboptimal results. The adoption of BERT, trained on a large dataset of 100k reviews, significantly improved performance, showcasing the benefits of advanced transformer-based models for sentiment analysis tasks. Shriraj K. Vaidya Exploring DL Compiler Optimizations with TVM When & Where: Thursday, December 19, 2024 - 1:30 PM Nichols Hall, Room 246 (Executive Conference Room) Committee Members: Prasad Kulkarni, Chair Dongjie Wang Zijun Yao Abstract Deep Learning (DL) compilers, also called Machine Learning (ML) compilers, take a computational graph representation of a ML model as input and apply graph-level and operator-level optimizations to generate optimized machine-code for different supported hardware architectures. DL compilers can apply several graph-level optimizations, including operator fusion, constant folding, and data layout transformations to convert the input computation graph into a functionally equivalent and optimized variant. The DL compilers also perform kernel scheduling, which is the task of finding the most efficient implementation for the operators in the computational graph. While many research efforts have focused on exploring different kernel scheduling techniques and algorithms, the benefits of individual computation graph-level optimizations are not as well studied. In this work, we employ the TVM compiler to perform a comprehensive study of the impact of different graph-level optimizations on the performance of DL models on CPUs and GPUs. We find that TVM's graph optimizations can improve model performance by up to 41.73% on CPUs and 41.6% on GPUs, and by 16.75% and 21.89%, on average, on CPUs and GPUs, respectively, on our custom benchmark suite. Rizwan Khan Fatigue crack segmentation of steel bridges using deep learning models - a comparative study. When & Where: Thursday, December 19, 2024 - 1:00 PM Learned Hall, Room 3131 Committee Members: David Johnson, Chair Hongyang Sun Abstract Structural health monitoring (SHM) is crucial for maintaining the safety and durability of infrastructure. To address the limitations of traditional inspection methods, this study leverages cutting-edge deep learning-based segmentation models for autonomous crack identification. Specifically, we utilized the recently launched YOLOv11 model, alongside the established DeepLabv3+ model for crack segmentation. Mask R-CNN, a widely recognized model in crack segmentation studies, is used as the baseline approach for comparison. Our approach integrates the CREC cropping strategy to optimize dataset preparation and employs post-processing techniques, such as dilation and erosion, to refine segmentation results. Experimental results demonstrate that our method\u2014combining state-of-the-art models, innovative data preparation strategies, and targeted post-processing\u2014achieves superior mean Intersection-over-Union (mIoU) performance compared to the baseline, showcasing its potential for precise and efficient crack detection in SHM systems Zhaohui Wang Enhancing Security and Privacy of IoT Systems: Uncovering and Resolving Cross-App Threats When & Where: Wednesday, December 18, 2024 - 1:00 PM Nichols Hall, Room 250 (Gemini Room) Committee Members: Fengjun Li, Chair Alex Bardas Drew Davidson Bo Luo Haiyang Chao Abstract The rapid growth of Internet of Things (IoT) technology has brought unprecedented convenience to our daily lives, enabling users to customize automation rules and develop IoT apps to meet their specific needs. However, as IoT devices interact with multiple apps across various platforms, users are exposed to complex security and privacy risks. Even interactions among seemingly harmless apps can introduce unforeseen security and privacy threats. In this work, we introduce two innovative approaches to uncover and address these concealed threats in IoT environments. The first approach investigates hidden cross-app privacy leakage risks in IoT apps. These risks arise from cross-app chains that are formed among multiple seemingly benign IoT apps. Our analysis reveals that interactions between apps can expose sensitive information such as user identity, location, tracking data, and activity patterns. We quantify these privacy leaks by assigning probability scores to evaluate the risks based on inferences. Additionally, we provide a fine-grained categorization of privacy threats to generate detailed alerts, enabling users to better understand and address specific privacy risks. To systematically detect cross-app interference threats, we propose to apply principles of logical fallacies to formalize conflicts in rule interactions. We identify and categorize cross-app interference by examining relations between events in IoT apps. We define new risk metrics for evaluating the severity of these interferences and use optimization techniques to resolve interference threats efficiently. This approach ensures comprehensive coverage of cross-app interference, offering a systematic solution compared to the ad hoc methods used in previous research. To enhance forensic capabilities within IoT, we integrate blockchain technology to create a secure, immutable framework for digital forensics. This framework enables the identification, tracing, storage, and analysis of forensic information to detect anomalous behavior. Furthermore, we developed a large-scale, manually verified, comprehensive dataset of real-world IoT apps. This clean and diverse benchmark dataset supports the development and validation of IoT security and privacy solutions. Each of these approaches has been evaluated using our dataset of real-world apps, collectively offering valuable insights and tools for enhancing IoT security and privacy against cross-app threats. Manu Chaudhary Utilizing Quantum Computing for Solving Multidimensional Partial Differential Equations When & Where: Tuesday, December 17, 2024 - 1:00 PM Eaton Hall, Room 2001B Committee Members: Esam El-Araby, Chair Perry Alexander Tamzidul Hoque Prasad Kulkarni Tyrone Duncan Abstract Quantum computing has the potential to revolutionize computational problem-solving by leveraging the quantum mechanical phenomena of superposition and entanglement, which allows for processing a large amount of information simultaneously. This capability is significant in the numerical solution of complex and/or multidimensional partial differential equations (PDEs), which are fundamental to modeling various physical phenomena. There are currently many quantum techniques available for solving partial differential equations (PDEs), which are mainly based on variational quantum circuits. However, the existing quantum PDE solvers, particularly those based on variational quantum eigensolver (VQE) techniques, suffer from several limitations. These include low accuracy, high execution times, and low scalability on quantum simulators as well as on noisy intermediate-scale quantum (NISQ) devices, especially for multidimensional PDEs. In this work, we propose an efficient and scalable algorithm for solving multidimensional PDEs. We present two variants of our algorithm: the first leverages finite-difference method (FDM), classical-to-quantum (C2Q) encoding, and numerical instantiation, while the second employs FDM, C2Q, and column-by-column decomposition (CCD). Both variants are designed to enhance accuracy and scalability while reducing execution times. We have validated and evaluated our algorithm using the multidimensional Poisson equation as a case study. Our results demonstrate higher accuracy, higher scalability, and faster execution times compared to VQE-based solvers on noise-free and noisy quantum simulators from IBM. Additionally, we validated our approach on hardware emulators and actual quantum hardware, employing noise mitigation techniques. We will also focus on extending these techniques to PDEs relevant to computational fluid dynamics and financial modeling, further bridging the gap between theoretical quantum algorithms and practical applications. Hao Xuan A Unified Algorithmic Framework for Biological Sequence Alignment When & Where: Tuesday, December 17, 2024 - 1:00 PM Nichols Hall, Room 250 (Gemini Room) Committee Members: Cuncong Zhong, Chair Fengjun Li Suzanne Shontz Hongyang Sun Liang Xu Abstract Sequence alignment is pivotal in both homology searches and the mapping of reads from next-generation sequencing (NGS) and third-generation sequencing (TGS) technologies. Currently, the majority of sequence alignment algorithms utilize the \u201cseed-and-extend\u201d paradigm, designed to filter out unrelated or nonhomologous sequences when no highly similar subregions are detected. A well-known implementation of this paradigm is BLAST, one of the most widely used multipurpose aligners. Over time, this paradigm has been optimized in various ways to suit different alignment tasks. However, while these specialized aligners often deliver high performance and efficiency, they are typically restricted to one or few alignment applications. To the best of our knowledge, no existing aligner can perform all alignment tasks while maintaining superior performance and efficiency. In this work, we introduce a unified sequence alignment framework to address this limitation. Our alignment framework is built on the seed-and-extend paradigm but incorporates novel designs in its seeding and indexing components to maximize both flexibility and efficiency. The resulting software, the Versatile Alignment Toolkit (VAT), allows the users to switch seamlessly between nearly all major alignment tasks through command-line parameter configuration. VAT was rigorously benchmarked against leading aligners for DNA and protein homolog searches, NGS and TGS read mapping, and whole-genome alignment. The results demonstrated VAT\u2019s top-tier performance across all benchmarks, underscoring the feasibility of using a unified algorithmic framework to handle diverse alignment tasks. VAT can simplify and standardize bioinformatic analysis workflows that involve multiple alignment tasks. Venkata Sai Krishna Chaitanya Addepalli A Comprehensive Approach to Facial Emotion Recognition: Integrating Established Techniques with a Tailored Model When & Where: Tuesday, December 17, 2024 - 11:00 AM Eaton Hall, Room 2001B Committee Members: David Johnson, Chair Prasad Kulkarni Hongyang Sun Abstract Facial emotion recognition has become a pivotal application of machine learning, enabling advancements in human-computer interaction, behavioral analysis, and mental health monitoring. Despite its potential, challenges such as data imbalance, variation in expressions, and noisy datasets often hinder accurate prediction. This project presents a novel approach to facial emotion recognition by integrating established techniques like data augmentation and regularization with a tailored convolutional neural network (CNN) architecture. Using the FER2013 dataset, the study explores the impact of incremental architectural improvements, optimized hyperparameters, and dropout layers to enhance model performance. The proposed model effectively addresses issues related to data imbalance and overfitting while achieving enhanced accuracy and precision in emotion classification. The study underscores the importance of feature extraction through convolutional layers and optimized fully connected networks for efficient emotion recognition. The results demonstrate improvements in generalization, setting a foundation for future real-time applications in diverse fields. Tejarsha Arigila Benchmarking Aggregation Free Federated Learning using Data Condensation:  Comparison with Federated Averaging When & Where: Monday, December 16, 2024 - 3:00 PM Eaton Hall, Room 2001B Committee Members: Fengjun Li, Chair Bo Luo Sumaiya Shomaji Abstract This project investigates the performance of Federated Learning Aggregation-Free (FedAF) compared to traditional federated learning methods under non-independent and identically distributed (non-IID) data conditions, characterized by Dirichlet distribution parameters (alpha = 0.02, 0.05, 0.1). Utilizing the MNIST and CIFAR-10 datasets, the study benchmarks FedAF against Federated Averaging (FedAVG) in terms of accuracy, convergence speed, communication efficiency, and robustness to label and feature skews. Traditional federated learning approaches like FedAVG aggregate locally trained models at a central server to form a global model. However, these methods often encounter challenges such as client drift in heterogeneous data environments, which can adversely affect model accuracy and convergence rates. FedAF introduces an innovative aggregation-free strategy wherein clients collaboratively generate a compact set of condensed synthetic data. This data, augmented by soft labels from the clients, is transmitted to the server, which then uses it to train the global model. This approach effectively reduces client drift and enhances resilience to data heterogeneity. Additionally, by compressing the representation of real data into condensed synthetic data, FedAF improves privacy by minimizing the transfer of raw data. The experimental results indicate that while FedAF converges faster, it struggles to stabilize under highly heterogenous environments due to limited real data representation capacity of condensed synthetic data.",

    "text": "EECS Shop Location: 3060 Eaton Hall Hours: Monday - Friday; 7:30am - 5:30pm General Policies Students need a shop account to check out lab tools. This account is separate from the department user accounts. Required information for account creation will include proof of enrollment, a valid KU ID card, EECS e-mail address and phone number. It is advisable to verify the existence of the account prior to the first day of lab. Students are allowed to check out equipment under their personal account only. The account owner is responsible for any equipment checked out under their account. A KUID card is required to check out equipment.\u00a0 No equipment will be issued without presenting your KUID card. It is the individual's responsibility to verify that the items checked out are complete before leaving the Shop service area (i.e. probe kit contents). The contents will be checked for completeness upon return. If any items are missing upon return, the account will be locked. Equipment will be checked out in a neat, organized fashion, and should be returned in the same manner. Each student has the right to refuse a disorganized probe kit, as does the EECS Shop. Lost or damaged equipment must be reported immediately. Normal wear and tear of hand tools and equipment is expected. Willful neglect or abuse will not be tolerated. No food or drink is allowed in any of the EECS labs. Equipment Checkout Policy Tools can be checked out at any time during normal office hours. All checked equipment should be returned as soon as the lab period is over if not still in use. Tools and equipment are a shared resource and, at times, used by several different labs concurrently. Scheduled labs have priority on equipment checkout. The tool checkout program will keep track of late returns and will assign an infraction to the account, every 24 hours. Three consecutive infractions are allowed and the account will be locked on the fourth infraction accrued. The lockout will be cleared only with the authorization of the class professor. List of tools available for checkout: Probe kits, soldering irons, strippers, dikes, wrap tools, needle nosed pliers, xactos, screwdrivers, DMMs, solder pumps, forceps, tweezers, bread boards, and LCR's. Fixed Equipment Care and Usage Proper care and operation of the fixed lab equipment is the responsibility of each student. If unfamiliar with the operation of the test equipment, seek the support of the GTA. Report any equipment failures immediately to the GTA in charge of the class. If a hard failure is verified, report it immediately. For computing equip, use the Help Request system of Engineering TSC. For lab test equipment, contact Tom Colwell, colwell@ku.edu . Ordering Parts Stocked parts may be ordered at EECS Shopkeeper. ( Note: You must be logged into the EECS network to access this page.) Most students in EECS courses will obtain parts from the lab GTA. Only students in 501/502, and 541/542 may order parts,\u00a0using EECS Shopkeeper for their class projects. GTA's should make a reasonable effort to project the needs of the course for the entire semester and convey those needs to the EECS Shop staff. Parts for \"canned\" projects will be \"kitted\" and given to TA's for class distribution.(ie EECS140,212,412) Parts orders will be sent to the shop account at the front Service Area. Shop Attendants will process most orders within 15 minutes of receipt. Shop Attendants will also distribute certain components (ie resistors, caps, transistors, diodes, etc. in small quantities) without formal electronic orders, for Capstone courses, if the request is deemed reasonable. IC's will require a formal electronic order to be placed, but will not require staff approval. Students will be granted limited access to peruse hardware items (nuts, bolts, etc.) that are stored in the front Storage Area. Students will not have \"carte blanche\" to all components in the storage area. PCB Fabrication Tools Requests for PCB milling may be made at the EECS PCB Milling Request page. This form must be fully completed before your request will be considered. Be sure to plan the \"lead time\" into your design and fabrication process. Boards will be milled for class projects only, and senior design courses and projects have priority. You will be notified if the shop cannot complete your milling request, so be sure to monitor your email. Lockers Students in the senior design courses will be allowed the use of a locker located in those rooms. These lockers will be held for the entire academic year. The locker must be registered with the TA. Security Codes Per the class professor's discretion, security codes will be issued at the beginning of the Fall semester for Senior Design Classes. Additional codes will be issued for other classes, as needed, and as directed by faculty members. Personal security codes must not be shared.\u00a0Store your code in a safe place.\u00a0 It will be your code for the duration of your term as an EECS student.",

    "text": "Facilities The Computing Commons and EECS Computer Labs The EECS department provides its students with more than 500 computers in thirteen laboratories. EECS computers run either Windows or Linux operating systems with powerful engineering specific software tools including MATLAB, CADence, and Xilinx packages. The Computing Commons, on the first floor of Eaton Hall, is open 24 hours a day, 7 days a week. EECS Hardware Labs Nine state-of-the-art laboratories provide students with experience in building, programming, testing, and debugging digital circuits, processors, and FPGA-based systems. A range of PC-based development platforms and instrumentation, such as spectrum analyzers, oscilloscopes and signal generators, are available at each workstation. Workstations support hardware design languages and programmable logic implementation. EECS students may checkout testing kits, tools, and other equipment from the EECS Shop. The EECS Shop Experienced EECS Shop attendants assist students in safely learning the art of engineering. The Shop houses advanced equipment including etching, drill, and SMD soldering stations. In-house milling ensures a quick turn-around of precise, reliable, and cost-effective fabricated boards for student projects. EECS students may checkout testing kits, tools, and other equipment from the shop. Shop personnel are happy to help students learn how to operate different machines or answer questions about equipment. Research Facilities EECS students and faculty work on multi-million dollar interdisciplinary research project at state-of-the-art research facilities including, the Center for the Remote Sensing of Ice Sheets (CReSIS), a NSF Science and Technology Center, and the Insitute for Information Sciences (I2S) . Eaton Hall 1520 W. 15th Street Eaton Hall was opened in fall 2003 and houses the administrative offices of the School of Engineering, as well as the Department of Electrical Engineering and Computer Science and the Engineering Career Center. The 80,000 square-foot building \u2014 named for Robert Eaton, a 1963 mechanical engineering alumnus and chairman emeritus of DaimlerChrysler AG \u2014 also houses several computer classrooms, laboratories, the Self Computing Commons and the state-of-the-art Spahr Engineering Classroom. Nichols Hall 2335 Irving Hill Road This facility on west campus houses numerous research labs affiliated with the School of Engineering, including the Information and Telecommunication Technology Center (I2S) and the NSF Center for Remote Sensing of Ice Sheets (CReSIS). The $2.4 million hall, designed by Hollis & Miller of Overland Park, opened in fall 1971 and was dedicated Sept. 29, 1972. It's design captures a space-age feel of the late '60s and early '70s and includes and features a central elevator and staircase that many may conclude served as inspiration for the main reactor in the first Star Wars movie. It was named for Raymond F. Nichols (1903-1999) KU's 12th chancellor.

Brian McClendon and the late Dale Rummer were honored during the department\u2019s graduation dinner and awards ceremony on April 28. \u201cThe KU EECS Department has an impressive and growing list of distinguished alumni and associates over its rich history, which spans over 130 years,\u201d said Brian Ruf, KU EECS advisory board chair when the department unveiled the award in February. \u201cWe felt that it was time to begin to more formally acknowledge and celebrate these individuals and their accomplishments.\u201d About the awardees Brian McClendon (BSEE, 1986) started his professional job with Intergraph Corporation; he spent eight years developing high-end workstation 3D graphics. In 2011, he was one of the original investors in Keyhole, Inc., a software visualization application, where he was the VP of Engineering. Google acquired Keyhole in 2004 and its main application suite Earth Viewer formed the basis of Google Earth. Brian served as VP of Engineering at Google for 10 years. He was elected a member of the National Academy of Engineering in 2015 for his strategic, technical, and managerial leadership resulting in widespread geographic information. McClendon holds 40 patents. He has been very generous in giving back to the University of Kansas in terms of his time, talent, means, and energy. McClendon is a long-time member of the Advisory Board of the EECS department and the School of Engineering and serves as a research professor in the EECS department. Bob Dale Rummer (BSEE,1948; Ph.D. EE, 1963) completed his Ph.D. in 1963 and accepted a job at Carter Oil in Tulsa, but was drawn back to academia and joined KU as an assistant professor of electrical engineering in 1964.

    "text": "Deficiency Courses Sections: Introduction General Information Electrical Engineering Computer Engineering Computer Science Information Technology Introduction This document lists the recommended undergraduate deficiency (makeup) courses for those seeking Maters degrees in Electrical Engineering (EE), Computer Engineering (CoE), Computer Science (CS), or Information Technology (IT); and whose undergraduate degrees are in other disciplines. General KU EECS Master's Programs are designed to be completed in approximately two years by students who are studying full time (not also working) and who already have an undergraduate degree in the same major as the proposed master's major. If you have studied EE, CoE, CS, or IT as an undergraduate, it is most efficient to get your MS degree in the same discipline. If you studied something else as an undergraduate, like Math, Physics, Psychology, Economics, etc., it will be necessary to take a significant number of undergraduate courses which will not count toward the Master's Degree. The set of \"extra\" courses which a particular student must take is determined for each student by the EECS Graduate Studies Committee andmust be taken before enrolling in graduate courses at KU. There are two purposes for these extra deficiency courses: To make sure that each student is prepared for the Master's courses, in terms of prerequisites. To make sure that upon graduation the student can legitimately claim the title \"Electrical Engineer\", \"Computer Engineer\", \"Computer Scientist\", or \"Information Technologist\". This includes being able to do the typical things that an undergraduate degree holder would be able to do in the area in question. In almost all cases a student who is shifting majors already has these same objectives, and we have found that such students are happy to take the extra undergraduate courses we have required. You can decide if the deficiency courses are taken at KU or at another accredited college or university.\u00a0Prior approval by the graduate committee is required if taken elsewhere. The following lists are typical requirements. The key is that the student be able to handle the highest level courses in sequences of courses. We suggest that each individual start at the highest comfortable point in each sequence. We may require that you take certain undergraduate courses before being admitted to the Graduate Program. In such cases, ultimate admission will depend on adequate performance in these courses, i.e., minimum KU GPA of 3.0 or better. The following courses are KU courses which contain material needed. It is not necessary that incoming students have the same courses as our undergraduates take, but the match should be reasonably good, as determined by the EECS Graduate Studies Committee. Candidates for MS in EE The following courses are required (note that these courses have prerequisites, as listed in the EECS Undergraduate Handbook): Courses Candidates for MS in CoE The following courses are required (note that these courses have prerequisites, as listed in the EECS Undergraduate Handbook): Courses Candidates for MS in CS The following courses are required (note that these courses have prerequisites, as listed in the EECS Undergraduate Handbook): Courses Candidates for MS in IT The following courses are required (note that these courses have prerequisites, as listed in the EECS Undergraduate Handbook):",

    "text": "Optical Fiber Measurements: Leveraging Coherent FMCW Techniques Student Name: Fatima Al-Shaikhli Defense Date: Monday, April 28, 2025 - 2:00 PM Location: Nichols Hall, Room 246 (Executive Conference Room) Chair: Rongqing Hui Shannon Blunt Shima Fardad Alessandro Salandrino Judy Wu Abstract: Recent advancements in optical fiber technology have proven to be invaluable in a variety of fields, extending far beyond high-speed communications. These innovations enable optical fiber sensing, which plays a critical role across diverse applications, from medical diagnostics to infrastructure monitoring and automotive systems. This research focuses on leveraging commercially available coherent optical transceiver systems to develop novel measurement techniques for characterizing optical fiber properties. Specifically, our goal is to leverage a digitally chirped frequency-modulated continuous wave (FMCW) to extract detailed information about optical fiber characteristics, as well as target range. Through this approach, we aim to enable more accurate and fast assessments of fiber performance and integrity, while exploring the potential for utilizing existing optical communication networks to enhance fiber characterization capabilities. This goal is investigated through three distinct projects: (1) fiber type characterization based on intensity-modulated electrostriction response, (2) self-homodyne coherent Light Detection and Ranging (LiDAR) system for target range and velocity detection, and (3) birefringence measurements using a coherent Polarization-sensitive Optical Frequency Domain Reflectometer (OFDR) system. Electrostriction in an optical fiber is introduced by interaction between the forward propagated optical signal and the acoustic standing waves in the radial direction resonating between the center of the core and the cladding circumference of the fiber. The response of electrostriction is dependent on fiber parameters, especially the mode field radius. We demonstrated a novel technique of identifying fiber types through the measurement of intensity modulation induced electrostriction response. As the spectral envelope of electrostriction induced propagation loss is anti-symmetrical, the signal to noise ratio can be significantly increased by subtracting the measured spectrum from its complex conjugate. We show that if the field distribution of the fiber propagation mode is Gaussian, the envelope of the electrostriction-induced loss spectrum closely follows a Maxwellian distribution whose shape can be specified by a single parameter determined by the mode field radius. We also present a self-homodyne FMCW LiDAR system based on a coherent receiver. By using the same linearly chirped waveform for both the LiDAR signal and the local oscillator, the self-homodyne coherent receiver performs frequency de-chirping directly in the photodiodes, significantly simplifying signal processing. As a result, the required receiver bandwidth is much lower than the chirping bandwidth of the signal. Multi-target detection is demonstrated experimentally, and while only amplitude modulation is required in the LiDAR transmitter, the phase-diversity coherent receiver enables simultaneous detection of both range and velocity for each target, along with the sign of the target\u2019s velocity. In addition, we demonstrate a polarization-sensitive OFDR system utilizing a commercially available digital coherent optical transceiver to generate a linear frequency chirp via carrier-suppressed single-sideband modulation. This method ensures linearity in chirping and phase continuity of the optical carrier. The coherent homodyne receiver, incorporating both polarization and phase diversity, recovers the state of polarization (SOP) of the backscattered optical signal along the fiber, mixing with an identically chirped local oscillator. With a spatial resolution of approximately , a chirping bandwidth, and a measurement time, this system enables precise birefringence measurements. By employing three mutually orthogonal SOPs of the launched optical signal, we can measure birefringence vectors along the fiber, providing not only the magnitude of birefringence but also the direction of any external pressure applied to the fiber.

    "text": "Understanding and Mitigating Security Risks towards Trustworthy Deep Learning Systems Student Name: Liangqin Ren Defense Date: Tuesday, April 22, 2025 - 9:00 AM Location: Nichols Hall, Room 250 (Gemini Room) Chair: Fengjun Li Drew Davidson Bo Luo Zijun Yao Xinmai Yang Abstract: Deep learning is widely used in healthcare, finance, and other critical domains, raising concerns about system trustworthiness. However, deep learning models and data still face three types of critical attacks: model theft, identity impersonation, and abuse of AI-generated content (AIGC). To address model theft, homomorphic encryption has been explored for privacy-preserving inference, but it remains highly inefficient. To counter identity impersonation, prior work focuses on detection, disruption, and tracing\u2014yet fails to protect source and target images simultaneously. To prevent AIGC abuse, methods like evaluation, watermarking, and machine unlearning exist, but text-driven image editing remains largely unprotected. This report addresses the above challenges through three key designs. First, to enable privacy-preserving inference while accelerating homomorphic encryption, we propose PrivDNN, which selectively encrypts the most critical model parameters, significantly reducing encrypted operations. We design a selection score to evaluate neuron importance and use a greedy algorithm to iteratively secure the most impactful neurons. Across four models and datasets, PrivDNN reduces encrypted operations by 85%\u201398%, and cuts inference time and memory usage by over 97% while preserving accuracy and privacy. Second, to counter identity impersonation in deepfake face-swapping, where both the source and target can be exploited, we introduce PhantomSeal, which embeds invisible perturbations to encode a hidden\u00a0\u201ccloak\u201d identity. When used as a target, the resulting content displays visible artifacts; when used as a source, the generated deepfake is altered to resemble the cloak identity. Evaluations across two generations of deepfake face-swapping show that PhantomSeal reduces attack success from 97% to 0.8%, with 95% of outputs recognized as the cloak identity, providing robust protection against manipulation. Third, to prevent AIGC abuse, we construct a comprehensive dataset, perform large-scale human evaluation, and establish a benchmark for detecting AI-generated artwork to better understand abuse risks in AI-generated content. Building on this direction, we propose Protecting Copyright against Image Editing (PCIE) to address copyright infringement in text-driven image editing. PCIE embeds an invisible copyright mark into the original image, which transforms into a visible watermark after text-driven editing to automatically reveal ownership upon unauthorized modification.

Simulation results demonstrate that our approach reduces system queue backlog and improves fairness compared to round-robin and traditional index-based baselines.

    "text": "Efficient and Effective Object Detection and Recognition: from Convolutions to Transformers Student Name: Tianxiao Zhang Defense Date: Thursday, April 17, 2025 - 9:30 AM Location: Eaton Hall, Room 2001B Chair: Bo Luo Prasad Kulkarni Fengjun Li Cuncong Zhong Guanghui Wang Huazhen Fang Abstract: With the development of Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs), computer vision has entered a new era, significantly enhancing the performance of tasks such as image classification, object detection, segmentation, and recognition. Furthermore, the introduction of Transformer architectures has brought the attention mechanism and a global perspective to computer vision, advancing the field to a new level. The inductive bias inherent in CNNs makes convolutional models particularly well-suited for processing images and videos. On the other hand, the attention mechanism in Transformer models allows them to capture global relationships between tokens. While Transformers often require more data and longer training periods compared to their convolutional counterparts, they have the potential to achieve comparable or even superior performance when the constraints of data availability and training time are mitigated. In this work, we propose more efficient and effective CNNs and Transformers to increase the performance of object detection and recognition. (1) A novel approach is proposed for real-time detection and tracking of small golf balls by combining object detection with the Kalman filter. Several classical object detection models were implemented and compared in terms of detection precision and speed. (2) To address the domain shift problem in object detection, we employ generative adversarial networks (GANs) to generate images from different domains. The original RGB images are concatenated with the corresponding GAN-generated images to form a 6-channel representation, improving model performance across domains. (3) A dynamic strategy for improving label assignment in modern object detection models is proposed. Rather than relying on fixed or statistics-based adaptive thresholds, a dynamic paradigm is introduced to define positive and negative samples. This allows more high-quality samples to be selected as positives, reducing the gap between classification and IoU scores and producing more accurate bounding boxes. (4) An efficient hybrid architecture combining Vision Transformers and convolutional layers is introduced for object recognition, particularly for small datasets. Lightweight depth-wise convolution modules bypass the entire Transformer block to capture local details that the Transformer backbone might overlook. The majority of the computations and parameters remain within the Transformer architecture, resulting in significantly improved performance with minimal overhead. (5) An innovative Multi-Overlapped-Head Self-Attention mechanism is introduced to enhance information exchange between heads in the Multi-Head Self-Attention mechanism of Vision Transformers. By overlapping adjacent heads during self-attention computation, information can flow between heads, leading to further improvements in vision recognition.

However, given the expanding societal needs coupled with a finite available spectrum, the question arises of how to increase the efficiency by which information may be transmitted. One natural answer to this question lies in spectrum sharing\u2014that is, in allowing multiple noncooperative agents to inhabit the same spectrum bands. In order to achieve this, we must be able to reliably separate the desired signals from those of other agents in the background. However, since our agents are noncooperative, we must develop a model-agnostic approach at tackling this problem. For this work, we will consider cohabitation between radar signals and communication signals, with the former being the desired signal and the latter being the noncooperative agent. In order to approach such problems involving highly underdetermined linear systems, we propose utilizing Sparse Bayesian Learning and present our results on selected problems.

One natural answer to this question lies in spectrum sharing\u2014that is, in allowing multiple noncooperative agents to inhabit the same spectrum bands. In order to achieve this, we must be able to reliably separate the desired signals from those of other agents in the background. However, since our agents are noncooperative, we must develop a model-agnostic approach at tackling this problem. For this work, we will consider cohabitation between radar signals and communication signals, with the former being the desired signal and the latter being the noncooperative agent. In order to approach such problems involving highly underdetermined linear systems, we propose utilizing Sparse Bayesian Learning and present our results on selected problems. Koyel Pramanick Detect Evidence of Compiler Triggered Security Measures in Binary Code When & Where: Monday, February 24, 2025 - 9:00 AM Eaton Hall, Room 2001B Committee Members: Prasad Kulkarni, Chair Drew Davidson Fengjun Li Bo Luo John Symons Abstract The primary goal of this thesis is to develop and explore techniques to identify security measures added by compilers in software binaries. These measures, added automatically during the build process, include runtime security checks like stack canaries, AddressSanitizer (ASan), and Control Flow Integrity (CFI), which help protect against memory errors, buffer overflows, and control flow attacks. This work also investigates how unresolved compiler warnings, especially those related to security, can be identified in binaries when the source code is unavailable. By studying the patterns and markers left by these compiler features, this thesis provides methods to analyze and verify the security provisions embedded in software binaries. These efforts aim to bridge the gap between compile-time diagnostics and binary-level analysis, offering a way to better understand the security protections applied during software compilation. Ultimately, this work seeks to make software more transparent and give users the tools to independently assess the security measures present in compiled software, fostering greater trust and accountability in software systems. Srinitha Kale AUTOMATING SYMBOL RECOGNITION IN SPOT IT: ADVANCING AI-POWERED DETECTION When & Where: Tuesday, February 4, 2025 - 11:00 AM Eaton Hall, Room 2001B Committee Members: David Johnson, Chair Esam El-Araby Prasad Kulkarni Abstract The \"Spot It!\" game, featuring 55 cards each with 8 unique symbols, presents a complex challenge of identifying a single matching symbol between any two cards. Addressing this challenge, machine learning has been employed to automate symbol recognition, enhancing gameplay and extending applications into areas like pattern recognition and visual search.\u00a0Due to the scarcity of available datasets, a comprehensive collection of 57 distinct Spot It symbols was created, with each class consisting of 1,800 augmented images. These images were manipulated through techniques such as scaling, rotation, and resizing to represent various visual scenarios.\u00a0Then developed a convolutional neural network (CNN) with five convolutional layers, batch normalization, and dropout layers, and employed the Adam optimizer to train model to accurately recognize these symbols. The robust dataset included over 102,600 images, each subject to extensive augmentation to improve the model's ability to generalize across different orientation and scaling conditions. The model was evaluated using 55 scanned \"Spot It!\" cards, where symbols were extracted and preprocessed for prediction. It achieved high accuracy in symbol identification, demonstrating significant resilience to common challenges such as rotations and scaling. This project illustrates the effective integration of data augmentation, deep learning, and computer vision techniques in tackling complex pattern recognition tasks, proving that artificial intelligence can significantly enhance traditional gaming experiences and create new opportunities in various fields. This project delves into the design, implementation, and testing of the CNN, providing a detailed analysis of its performance and highlighting its potential as a transformative tool in image recognition and categorization. Sudha Chandrika Yadlapalli BERT-Driven Sentiment Analysis: Automated Course Feedback Classification and Ratings When & Where: Friday, December 20, 2024 - 11:00 AM Eaton Hall, Room 2001B Committee Members: David Johnson, Chair Prasad Kulkarni Hongyang Sun Abstract Automating the analysis of unstructured textual data, such as student course feedback, is crucial for gaining actionable insights. This project focuses on developing a sentiment analysis system leveraging the DeBERTa-v3-base model, a variant of BERT (Bidirectional Encoder Representations from Transformers), to classify feedback sentiments and generate corresponding ratings on a 1-to-5 scale. A dataset of 100,000+ student reviews was preprocessed and fine-tuned on the model to handle class imbalances and capture contextual nuances. Training was conducted on high-performance A100 GPUs, which enhanced computational efficiency and reduced training times significantly. The trained BERT sentiment model demonstrated superior performance compared to traditional machine learning models, achieving ~82% accuracy in sentiment classification. The model was seamlessly integrated into a functional web application, providing a streamlined approach to evaluate and visualize course reviews dynamically. Key features include a course ratings dashboard, allowing students to view aggregated ratings for each course, and a review submission functionality where new feedback is analyzed for sentiment in real-time. For the department, an admin page provides secure access to detailed analytics, such as the distribution of positive and negative reviews, visualized trends, and the access to view individual course reviews with their corresponding sentiment scores. This project includes a comprehensive pipeline, starting from data preprocessing and model training to deploying an end-to-end application. Traditional machine learning models, such as Logistic Regression and Decision Tree, were initially tested but yielded suboptimal results. The adoption of BERT, trained on a large dataset of 100k reviews, significantly improved performance, showcasing the benefits of advanced transformer-based models for sentiment analysis tasks. Shriraj K. Vaidya Exploring DL Compiler Optimizations with TVM When & Where: Thursday, December 19, 2024 - 1:30 PM Nichols Hall, Room 246 (Executive Conference Room) Committee Members: Prasad Kulkarni, Chair Dongjie Wang Zijun Yao Abstract Deep Learning (DL) compilers, also called Machine Learning (ML) compilers, take a computational graph representation of a ML model as input and apply graph-level and operator-level optimizations to generate optimized machine-code for different supported hardware architectures. DL compilers can apply several graph-level optimizations, including operator fusion, constant folding, and data layout transformations to convert the input computation graph into a functionally equivalent and optimized variant. The DL compilers also perform kernel scheduling, which is the task of finding the most efficient implementation for the operators in the computational graph. While many research efforts have focused on exploring different kernel scheduling techniques and algorithms, the benefits of individual computation graph-level optimizations are not as well studied. In this work, we employ the TVM compiler to perform a comprehensive study of the impact of different graph-level optimizations on the performance of DL models on CPUs and GPUs. We find that TVM's graph optimizations can improve model performance by up to 41.73% on CPUs and 41.6% on GPUs, and by 16.75% and 21.89%, on average, on CPUs and GPUs, respectively, on our custom benchmark suite. Rizwan Khan Fatigue crack segmentation of steel bridges using deep learning models - a comparative study. When & Where: Thursday, December 19, 2024 - 1:00 PM Learned Hall, Room 3131 Committee Members: David Johnson, Chair Hongyang Sun Abstract Structural health monitoring (SHM) is crucial for maintaining the safety and durability of infrastructure. To address the limitations of traditional inspection methods, this study leverages cutting-edge deep learning-based segmentation models for autonomous crack identification. Specifically, we utilized the recently launched YOLOv11 model, alongside the established DeepLabv3+ model for crack segmentation. Mask R-CNN, a widely recognized model in crack segmentation studies, is used as the baseline approach for comparison. Our approach integrates the CREC cropping strategy to optimize dataset preparation and employs post-processing techniques, such as dilation and erosion, to refine segmentation results. Experimental results demonstrate that our method\u2014combining state-of-the-art models, innovative data preparation strategies, and targeted post-processing\u2014achieves superior mean Intersection-over-Union (mIoU) performance compared to the baseline, showcasing its potential for precise and efficient crack detection in SHM systems Zhaohui Wang Enhancing Security and Privacy of IoT Systems: Uncovering and Resolving Cross-App Threats When & Where: Wednesday, December 18, 2024 - 1:00 PM Nichols Hall, Room 250 (Gemini Room) Committee Members: Fengjun Li, Chair Alex Bardas Drew Davidson Bo Luo Haiyang Chao Abstract The rapid growth of Internet of Things (IoT) technology has brought unprecedented convenience to our daily lives, enabling users to customize automation rules and develop IoT apps to meet their specific needs. However, as IoT devices interact with multiple apps across various platforms, users are exposed to complex security and privacy risks. Even interactions among seemingly harmless apps can introduce unforeseen security and privacy threats. In this work, we introduce two innovative approaches to uncover and address these concealed threats in IoT environments. The first approach investigates hidden cross-app privacy leakage risks in IoT apps. These risks arise from cross-app chains that are formed among multiple seemingly benign IoT apps. Our analysis reveals that interactions between apps can expose sensitive information such as user identity, location, tracking data, and activity patterns. We quantify these privacy leaks by assigning probability scores to evaluate the risks based on inferences. Additionally, we provide a fine-grained categorization of privacy threats to generate detailed alerts, enabling users to better understand and address specific privacy risks. To systematically detect cross-app interference threats, we propose to apply principles of logical fallacies to formalize conflicts in rule interactions. We identify and categorize cross-app interference by examining relations between events in IoT apps. We define new risk metrics for evaluating the severity of these interferences and use optimization techniques to resolve interference threats efficiently. This approach ensures comprehensive coverage of cross-app interference, offering a systematic solution compared to the ad hoc methods used in previous research. To enhance forensic capabilities within IoT, we integrate blockchain technology to create a secure, immutable framework for digital forensics. This framework enables the identification, tracing, storage, and analysis of forensic information to detect anomalous behavior. Furthermore, we developed a large-scale, manually verified, comprehensive dataset of real-world IoT apps. This clean and diverse benchmark dataset supports the development and validation of IoT security and privacy solutions. Each of these approaches has been evaluated using our dataset of real-world apps, collectively offering valuable insights and tools for enhancing IoT security and privacy against cross-app threats. Manu Chaudhary Utilizing Quantum Computing for Solving Multidimensional Partial Differential Equations When & Where: Tuesday, December 17, 2024 - 1:00 PM Eaton Hall, Room 2001B Committee Members: Esam El-Araby, Chair Perry Alexander Tamzidul Hoque Prasad Kulkarni Tyrone Duncan Abstract Quantum computing has the potential to revolutionize computational problem-solving by leveraging the quantum mechanical phenomena of superposition and entanglement, which allows for processing a large amount of information simultaneously. This capability is significant in the numerical solution of complex and/or multidimensional partial differential equations (PDEs), which are fundamental to modeling various physical phenomena. There are currently many quantum techniques available for solving partial differential equations (PDEs), which are mainly based on variational quantum circuits. However, the existing quantum PDE solvers, particularly those based on variational quantum eigensolver (VQE) techniques, suffer from several limitations. These include low accuracy, high execution times, and low scalability on quantum simulators as well as on noisy intermediate-scale quantum (NISQ) devices, especially for multidimensional PDEs. In this work, we propose an efficient and scalable algorithm for solving multidimensional PDEs. We present two variants of our algorithm: the first leverages finite-difference method (FDM), classical-to-quantum (C2Q) encoding, and numerical instantiation, while the second employs FDM, C2Q, and column-by-column decomposition (CCD). Both variants are designed to enhance accuracy and scalability while reducing execution times. We have validated and evaluated our algorithm using the multidimensional Poisson equation as a case study. Our results demonstrate higher accuracy, higher scalability, and faster execution times compared to VQE-based solvers on noise-free and noisy quantum simulators from IBM. Additionally, we validated our approach on hardware emulators and actual quantum hardware, employing noise mitigation techniques. We will also focus on extending these techniques to PDEs relevant to computational fluid dynamics and financial modeling, further bridging the gap between theoretical quantum algorithms and practical applications. Hao Xuan A Unified Algorithmic Framework for Biological Sequence Alignment When & Where: Tuesday, December 17, 2024 - 1:00 PM Nichols Hall, Room 250 (Gemini Room) Committee Members: Cuncong Zhong, Chair Fengjun Li Suzanne Shontz Hongyang Sun Liang Xu Abstract Sequence alignment is pivotal in both homology searches and the mapping of reads from next-generation sequencing (NGS) and third-generation sequencing (TGS) technologies. Currently, the majority of sequence alignment algorithms utilize the \u201cseed-and-extend\u201d paradigm, designed to filter out unrelated or nonhomologous sequences when no highly similar subregions are detected. A well-known implementation of this paradigm is BLAST, one of the most widely used multipurpose aligners. Over time, this paradigm has been optimized in various ways to suit different alignment tasks. However, while these specialized aligners often deliver high performance and efficiency, they are typically restricted to one or few alignment applications. To the best of our knowledge, no existing aligner can perform all alignment tasks while maintaining superior performance and efficiency. In this work, we introduce a unified sequence alignment framework to address this limitation. Our alignment framework is built on the seed-and-extend paradigm but incorporates novel designs in its seeding and indexing components to maximize both flexibility and efficiency. The resulting software, the Versatile Alignment Toolkit (VAT), allows the users to switch seamlessly between nearly all major alignment tasks through command-line parameter configuration. VAT was rigorously benchmarked against leading aligners for DNA and protein homolog searches, NGS and TGS read mapping, and whole-genome alignment. The results demonstrated VAT\u2019s top-tier performance across all benchmarks, underscoring the feasibility of using a unified algorithmic framework to handle diverse alignment tasks. VAT can simplify and standardize bioinformatic analysis workflows that involve multiple alignment tasks. Venkata Sai Krishna Chaitanya Addepalli A Comprehensive Approach to Facial Emotion Recognition: Integrating Established Techniques with a Tailored Model When & Where: Tuesday, December 17, 2024 - 11:00 AM Eaton Hall, Room 2001B Committee Members: David Johnson, Chair Prasad Kulkarni Hongyang Sun Abstract Facial emotion recognition has become a pivotal application of machine learning, enabling advancements in human-computer interaction, behavioral analysis, and mental health monitoring. Despite its potential, challenges such as data imbalance, variation in expressions, and noisy datasets often hinder accurate prediction. This project presents a novel approach to facial emotion recognition by integrating established techniques like data augmentation and regularization with a tailored convolutional neural network (CNN) architecture. Using the FER2013 dataset, the study explores the impact of incremental architectural improvements, optimized hyperparameters, and dropout layers to enhance model performance. The proposed model effectively addresses issues related to data imbalance and overfitting while achieving enhanced accuracy and precision in emotion classification. The study underscores the importance of feature extraction through convolutional layers and optimized fully connected networks for efficient emotion recognition. The results demonstrate improvements in generalization, setting a foundation for future real-time applications in diverse fields. Tejarsha Arigila Benchmarking Aggregation Free Federated Learning using Data Condensation:  Comparison with Federated Averaging When & Where: Monday, December 16, 2024 - 3:00 PM Eaton Hall, Room 2001B Committee Members: Fengjun Li, Chair Bo Luo Sumaiya Shomaji Abstract This project investigates the performance of Federated Learning Aggregation-Free (FedAF) compared to traditional federated learning methods under non-independent and identically distributed (non-IID) data conditions, characterized by Dirichlet distribution parameters (alpha = 0.02, 0.05, 0.1). Utilizing the MNIST and CIFAR-10 datasets, the study benchmarks FedAF against Federated Averaging (FedAVG) in terms of accuracy, convergence speed, communication efficiency, and robustness to label and feature skews. Traditional federated learning approaches like FedAVG aggregate locally trained models at a central server to form a global model. However, these methods often encounter challenges such as client drift in heterogeneous data environments, which can adversely affect model accuracy and convergence rates. FedAF introduces an innovative aggregation-free strategy wherein clients collaboratively generate a compact set of condensed synthetic data. This data, augmented by soft labels from the clients, is transmitted to the server, which then uses it to train the global model. This approach effectively reduces client drift and enhances resilience to data heterogeneity. Additionally, by compressing the representation of real data into condensed synthetic data, FedAF improves privacy by minimizing the transfer of raw data. The experimental results indicate that while FedAF converges faster, it struggles to stabilize under highly heterogenous environments due to limited real data representation capacity of condensed synthetic data.",

Fatima Al-Shaikhli Optical Fiber Measurements: Leveraging Coherent FMCW Techniques When & Where: Monday, April 28, 2025 - 2:00 PM Nichols Hall, Room 246 (Executive Conference Room) Committee Members: Rongqing Hui, Chair Shannon Blunt Shima Fardad Alessandro Salandrino Judy Wu Abstract Recent advancements in optical fiber technology have proven to be invaluable in a variety of fields, extending far beyond high-speed communications. These innovations enable optical fiber sensing, which plays a critical role across diverse applications, from medical diagnostics to infrastructure monitoring and automotive systems. This research focuses on leveraging commercially available coherent optical transceiver systems to develop novel measurement techniques for characterizing optical fiber properties. Specifically, our goal is to leverage a digitally chirped frequency-modulated continuous wave (FMCW) to extract detailed information about optical fiber characteristics, as well as target range. Through this approach, we aim to enable more accurate and fast assessments of fiber performance and integrity, while exploring the potential for utilizing existing optical communication networks to enhance fiber characterization capabilities. This goal is investigated through three distinct projects: (1) fiber type characterization based on intensity-modulated electrostriction response, (2) self-homodyne coherent Light Detection and Ranging (LiDAR) system for target range and velocity detection, and (3) birefringence measurements using a coherent Polarization-sensitive Optical Frequency Domain Reflectometer (OFDR) system. Electrostriction in an optical fiber is introduced by interaction between the forward propagated optical signal and the acoustic standing waves in the radial direction resonating between the center of the core and the cladding circumference of the fiber. The response of electrostriction is dependent on fiber parameters, especially the mode field radius. We demonstrated a novel technique of identifying fiber types through the measurement of intensity modulation induced electrostriction response. As the spectral envelope of electrostriction induced propagation loss is anti-symmetrical, the signal to noise ratio can be significantly increased by subtracting the measured spectrum from its complex conjugate. We show that if the field distribution of the fiber propagation mode is Gaussian, the envelope of the electrostriction-induced loss spectrum closely follows a Maxwellian distribution whose shape can be specified by a single parameter determined by the mode field radius. We also present a self-homodyne FMCW LiDAR system based on a coherent receiver. By using the same linearly chirped waveform for both the LiDAR signal and the local oscillator, the self-homodyne coherent receiver performs frequency de-chirping directly in the photodiodes, significantly simplifying signal processing. As a result, the required receiver bandwidth is much lower than the chirping bandwidth of the signal. Multi-target detection is demonstrated experimentally, and while only amplitude modulation is required in the LiDAR transmitter, the phase-diversity coherent receiver enables simultaneous detection of both range and velocity for each target, along with the sign of the target\u2019s velocity. In addition, we demonstrate a polarization-sensitive OFDR system utilizing a commercially available digital coherent optical transceiver to generate a linear frequency chirp via carrier-suppressed single-sideband modulation. This method ensures linearity in chirping and phase continuity of the optical carrier. The coherent homodyne receiver, incorporating both polarization and phase diversity, recovers the state of polarization (SOP) of the backscattered optical signal along the fiber, mixing with an identically chirped local oscillator. With a spatial resolution of approximately , a chirping bandwidth, and a measurement time, this system enables precise birefringence measurements. By employing three mutually orthogonal SOPs of the launched optical signal, we can measure birefringence vectors along the fiber, providing not only the magnitude of birefringence but also the direction of any external pressure applied to the fiber. Liangqin Ren Understanding and Mitigating Security Risks towards Trustworthy Deep Learning Systems When & Where: Tuesday, April 22, 2025 - 9:00 AM Nichols Hall, Room 250 (Gemini Room) Committee Members: Fengjun Li, Chair Drew Davidson Bo Luo Zijun Yao Xinmai Yang Abstract Deep learning is widely used in healthcare, finance, and other critical domains, raising concerns about system trustworthiness. However, deep learning models and data still face three types of critical attacks: model theft, identity impersonation, and abuse of AI-generated content (AIGC). To address model theft, homomorphic encryption has been explored for privacy-preserving inference, but it remains highly inefficient. To counter identity impersonation, prior work focuses on detection, disruption, and tracing\u2014yet fails to protect source and target images simultaneously. To prevent AIGC abuse, methods like evaluation, watermarking, and machine unlearning exist, but text-driven image editing remains largely unprotected. This report addresses the above challenges through three key designs. First, to enable privacy-preserving inference while accelerating homomorphic encryption, we propose PrivDNN, which selectively encrypts the most critical model parameters, significantly reducing encrypted operations. We design a selection score to evaluate neuron importance and use a greedy algorithm to iteratively secure the most impactful neurons. Across four models and datasets, PrivDNN reduces encrypted operations by 85%\u201398%, and cuts inference time and memory usage by over 97% while preserving accuracy and privacy. Second, to counter identity impersonation in deepfake face-swapping, where both the source and target can be exploited, we introduce PhantomSeal, which embeds invisible perturbations to encode a hidden\u00a0\u201ccloak\u201d identity. When used as a target, the resulting content displays visible artifacts; when used as a source, the generated deepfake is altered to resemble the cloak identity. Evaluations across two generations of deepfake face-swapping show that PhantomSeal reduces attack success from 97% to 0.8%, with 95% of outputs recognized as the cloak identity, providing robust protection against manipulation. Third, to prevent AIGC abuse, we construct a comprehensive dataset, perform large-scale human evaluation, and establish a benchmark for detecting AI-generated artwork to better understand abuse risks in AI-generated content. Building on this direction, we propose Protecting Copyright against Image Editing (PCIE) to address copyright infringement in text-driven image editing. PCIE embeds an invisible copyright mark into the original image, which transforms into a visible watermark after text-driven editing to automatically reveal ownership upon unauthorized modification. Andrew Stratmann Efficient Index-Based Multi-User Scheduling for Mobile mmWave Networks: Balancing Channel Quality and User Experience When & Where: Monday, April 21, 2025 - 2:00 PM Eaton Hall, Room 2001B Committee Members: Morteza Hashemi, Chair Prasad Kulkarni Erik Perrins Abstract Millimeter Wave (mmWave) communication technologies have the potential to establish high data rates for next-generation wireless networks, as well as enable novel applications that were previously untenable due to high throughput requirements. \u00a0Yet reliable and efficient mmWave communication remains challenged by intermittent link quality due to user mobility and frequent line-of-sight (LoS) blockage, thereby making the links unavailable or more costly to use. \u00a0These factors are further exacerbated in multi-user settings where beam alignment overhead, limited RF chains, and heterogeneous user requirements must be balanced. \u00a0In this work, we present a hybrid multi-user scheduling solution that jointly accounts for mobility-and blockage-induced unavailability to enhance user experience in mmWave video streaming applications. \u00a0Our approach integrates two key components: (i) a blockage-aware scheduling strategy modeled via a Restless Multi-Armed Bandit (RMAB) formulation and prioritized using Whittle Indexing, and (ii) a mobility-aware geometric model that estimates beam alignment overhead cost as a function of receiver motion. \u00a0We develop a comprehensive and efficient index-based scheduler that fuses these models and leverages contextual information, such as receiver distance, mobility history, and queue state, to schedule multiple users in order to maximize throughput. Simulation results demonstrate that our approach reduces system queue backlog and improves fairness compared to round-robin and traditional index-based baselines. Tianxiao Zhang Efficient and Effective Object Detection and Recognition: from Convolutions to Transformers When & Where: Thursday, April 17, 2025 - 9:30 AM Eaton Hall, Room 2001B Committee Members: Bo Luo, Chair Prasad Kulkarni Fengjun Li Cuncong Zhong Guanghui Wang Abstract With the development of Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs), computer vision has entered a new era, significantly enhancing the performance of tasks such as image classification, object detection, segmentation, and recognition. Furthermore, the introduction of Transformer architectures has brought the attention mechanism and a global perspective to computer vision, advancing the field to a new level. The inductive bias inherent in CNNs makes convolutional models particularly well-suited for processing images and videos. On the other hand, the attention mechanism in Transformer models allows them to capture global relationships between tokens. While Transformers often require more data and longer training periods compared to their convolutional counterparts, they have the potential to achieve comparable or even superior performance when the constraints of data availability and training time are mitigated. In this work, we propose more efficient and effective CNNs and Transformers to increase the performance of object detection and recognition. (1) A novel approach is proposed for real-time detection and tracking of small golf balls by combining object detection with the Kalman filter. Several classical object detection models were implemented and compared in terms of detection precision and speed. (2) To address the domain shift problem in object detection, we employ generative adversarial networks (GANs) to generate images from different domains. The original RGB images are concatenated with the corresponding GAN-generated images to form a 6-channel representation, improving model performance across domains. (3) A dynamic strategy for improving label assignment in modern object detection models is proposed. Rather than relying on fixed or statistics-based adaptive thresholds, a dynamic paradigm is introduced to define positive and negative samples. This allows more high-quality samples to be selected as positives, reducing the gap between classification and IoU scores and producing more accurate bounding boxes. (4) An efficient hybrid architecture combining Vision Transformers and convolutional layers is introduced for object recognition, particularly for small datasets. Lightweight depth-wise convolution modules bypass the entire Transformer block to capture local details that the Transformer backbone might overlook. The majority of the computations and parameters remain within the Transformer architecture, resulting in significantly improved performance with minimal overhead. (5) An innovative Multi-Overlapped-Head Self-Attention mechanism is introduced to enhance information exchange between heads in the Multi-Head Self-Attention mechanism of Vision Transformers. By overlapping adjacent heads during self-attention computation, information can flow between heads, leading to further improvements in vision recognition.

Mohammed Misbah Zarrar Efficient End-to-End Deep Learning for Autonomous Racing: TinyLidarNet and Low-Power Computing Platforms When & Where: Monday, December 16, 2024 - 12:00 PM Eaton Hall, Room 2001B Committee Members: Heechul Yun, Chair Prasad Kulkarni Bo Luo Abstract End-to-end deep learning has proven effective for robotic navigation by deriving control signals directly from raw sensory data. However, the majority of existing end-to-end navigation solutions are predominantly camera-based. We propose TinyLidarNet, a lightweight 2D LiDAR-based end-to-end deep learning model for autonomous racing. We systematically analyze its performance on untrained tracks and computing requirements for real-time processing. We find that TinyLidarNet's 1D Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) based architecture significantly outperforms widely used Multi-Layer Perceptron (MLP) based architecture. In addition, we show that it can be processed in real-time on low-end micro-controller units (MCUs). We deployed TinyLidarNet on an MCU-based F1TENTH platform, which is comprised of an ESP32-S3 MCU and a RPLiDAR sensor and demonstrated the feasibility of using MCUs in F1TENTH autonomous racing. Finally, we compare TinyLidarNet with ForzaETH, a\u00a0state-of-the-art Model Predictive Controller (MPC) based F1TENTH racing stack. Our results show that TinyLidarNet is able to closely match the performance of ForzaETH by training the model using the data generated by ForzaETH Ye Wang Deceptive Signals: Unveiling and Countering Sensor Spoofing Attacks on Cyber Systems When & Where: Monday, December 16, 2024 - 10:00 AM Nichols Hall, Room 250 (Gemini Room) Committee Members: Fengjun Li, Chair Drew Davidson Rongqing Hui Bo Luo Haiyang Chao Abstract In modern computer systems, sensors play a critical role in enabling a wide range of functionalities, from navigation in autonomous vehicles to environmental monitoring in smart homes. Acting as an interface between physical and digital worlds, sensors collect data to drive automated functionalities and decision-making. However, this reliance on sensor data introduces significant potential vulnerabilities, leading to various physical, sensor-enabled attacks such as spoofing, tampering, and signal injection. Sensor spoofing attacks, where adversaries manipulate sensor input or inject false data into target systems, pose serious risks to system security and privacy. In this work, we have developed two novel sensor spoofing attack methods that significantly enhance both efficacy and practicality. The first method employs physical signals that are imperceptible to humans but detectable by sensors. Specifically, we target deep learning based facial recognition systems using infrared lasers. By leveraging advanced laser modeling, simulation-guided targeting, and real-time physical adjustments, our infrared laser-based physical adversarial attack achieves high success rates with practical real-time guarantees, surpassing the limitations of prior physical perturbation attacks. The second method embeds physical signals, which are inherently present in the system, into legitimate patterns. In particular, we integrate trigger signals into standard operational patterns of actuators on mobile devices to construct remote logic bombs, which are shown to be able to evade all existing detection mechanisms. Achieving a zero false-trigger rate with high success rates, this novel sensor bomb is highly effective and stealthy. Our study on emerging sensor-based threats highlights the urgent need for comprehensive defenses against sensor spoofing. Along this direction, we design and investigate two defense strategies to mitigate these threats. The first strategy involves filtering out physical signals identified as potential attack vectors. The second strategy is to leverage beneficial physical signals to obfuscate malicious patterns and reinforce data integrity. For example, side channels targeting the same sensor can be used to introduce cover signals that prevent information leakage, while environment-based physical signals serve as signatures to authenticate data. Together, these strategies form a comprehensive defense framework that filters harmful sensor signals and utilizes beneficial ones, significantly enhancing the overall security of cyber systems. SM Ishraq-Ul Islam Quantum Circuit Synthesis using Genetic Algorithms Combined with Fuzzy Logic When & Where: Friday, December 13, 2024 - 3:00 PM LEEP2, Room 1420 Committee Members: Esam El-Araby, Chair Tamzidul Hoque Prasad Kulkarni Abstract Quantum computing emerges as a promising direction for high-performance computing in the post-Moore era. Leveraging quantum mechanical properties, quantum devices can theoretically provide significant speedup over classical computers in certain problem domains. Quantum algorithms are typically expressed as quantum circuits composed of quantum gates, or as unitary matrices. Execution of quantum algorithms on physical devices requires translation to machine-compatible circuits -- a process referred to as quantum compilation or synthesis. Quantum synthesis is a challenging problem. Physical quantum devices support a limited number of native basis gates, requiring synthesized circuits to be composed of only these gates. Moreover, quantum devices typically have specific qubit topologies, which constrain how and where gates can be applied. Consequently, logical qubits in input circuits and unitaries may need to be mapped to and routed between physical qubits on the device. Current Noisy Intermediate-Scale Quantum (NISQ) devices present additional constraints, through their gate errors and high susceptibility to noise. NISQ devices are vulnerable to errors during gate application and their short decoherence times leads to qubits rapidly succumbing to accumulated noise and possibly corrupting computations. Therefore, circuits synthesized for NISQ devices need to have a low number of gates to reduce gate errors, and short execution times to avoid qubit decoherence. The problem of synthesizing device-compatible quantum circuits, while optimizing for low gate count and short execution times, can be shown to be computationally intractable using analytical methods. Therefore, interest has grown towards heuristics-based compilation techniques, which are able to produce approximations of the desired algorithm to a required degree of precision. In this work, we investigate using Genetic Algorithms (GAs) -- a proven gradient-free optimization technique based on natural selection -- for circuit synthesis. In particular, we formulate the quantum synthesis problem as a multi-objective optimization (MOO) problem, with the objectives of minimizing the approximation error, number of multi-qubit gates, and circuit depth. We also employ fuzzy logic for runtime parameter adaptation of GA to enhance search efficiency and solution quality of our proposed quantum synthesis method. Sravan Reddy Chintareddy Combating Spectrum Crunch with Efficient Machine-Learning Based Spectrum Access and Harnessing High-frequency Bands for Next-G Wireless Networks When & Where: Friday, December 13, 2024 - 12:00 PM Nichols Hall, Room 246 (Executive Conference Room) Committee Members: Morteza Hashemi, Chair Victor Frost Erik Perrins Dongjie Wang Shawn Keshmiri Abstract There is an increasing trend in the number of wireless devices that is now already over 14 billion and is expected to grow to 40 billion devices by 2030. In addition, we are witnessing an unprecedented proliferation of applications and technologies with wireless connectivity requirements such as unmanned aerial vehicles, connected health, and radars for autonomous vehicles. The advent of new wireless technologies and devices will only worsen the current spectrum crunch that service providers and wireless operators are already experiencing. In this PhD study, we address these challenges through the following research thrusts, in which we consider two emerging applications aimed at advancing spectrum efficiency and high-frequency connectivity solutions. First, we focus on effectively utilizing the existing spectrum resources for emerging applications such as networked UAVs operating within the Unmanned Traffic Management (UTM) system. In this thrust, we develop a coexistence framework for UAVs to share spectrum with traditional cellular networks by using machine learning (ML) techniques so that networked UAVs act as secondary users without interfering with primary users. We propose federated learning (FL) and reinforcement learning (RL) solutions to establish a collaborative spectrum sensing and dynamic spectrum allocation framework for networked UAVs. In the second part, we explore the potential of millimeter-wave (mmWave) and terahertz (THz) frequency bands for high-speed data transmission in urban settings. Specifically, we investigate THz-based midhaul links for 5G networks, where a network's central units (CUs) connect to distributed units (DUs). Through numerical analysis, we assess the feasibility of using 140 GHz links and demonstrate the merits of high-frequency bands to support high data rates in midhaul networks for future urban communications infrastructure. Overall, this research is aimed at establishing frameworks and methodologies that contribute toward the sustainable growth and evolution of wireless connectivity. Arnab Mukherjee Attention-Based Solutions for Occlusion Challenges in Person Tracking When & Where: Thursday, December 12, 2024 - 11:00 AM Eaton Hall, Room 2001B Committee Members: Prasad Kulkarni, Chair Sumaiya Shomaji Hongyang Sun Jian Li Abstract Person tracking and association is a complex task in computer vision applications. Even with a powerful detector, a highly accurate association algorithm is necessary to match and track the correct person across all frames. This method has numerous applications in surveillance, and its complexity increases with the number of detected objects and their movements across frames. A significant challenge in person tracking is occlusion, which occurs when an individual being tracked is partially or fully blocked by another object or person. This can make it difficult for the tracking system to maintain the identity of the individual and track them effectively. In this research, we propose a solution to the occlusion problem by utilizing an occlusion-aware spatial attention transformer. We have divided the entire tracking association process into two scenarios: occlusion and no-occlusion. When a detected person with a specific ID suddenly disappears from a frame for a certain period, we employ advanced methods such as Detector Integration and Pose Estimation to ensure the correct association. Additionally, we implement a spatial attention transformer to differentiate these occluded detections, transform them, and then match them with the correct individual using the Cosine Similarity Metric. The features extracted from the attention transformer provide a robust baseline for detecting people, enhancing the algorithms adaptability and addressing key challenges associated with existing approaches. This improved method reduces the number of misidentifications and instances of ID switching while also enhancing tracking accuracy and precision. Agraj Magotra Data-Driven Insights into Sustainability: An Artificial Intelligence (AI) Powered Analysis of ESG Practices in the Textile and Apparel Industry When & Where: Wednesday, December 11, 2024 - 12:00 PM Eaton Hall, Room 2001B Committee Members: Sumaiya Shomaji, Chair Prasad Kulkarni Zijun Yao Abstract The global textile and apparel (T&A) industry is under growing scrutiny for its substantial environmental and social impact, producing 92 million tons of waste annually and contributing to 20% of global water pollution. In Bangladesh, one of the world's largest apparel exporters, the integration of Environmental, Social, and Governance (ESG) practices is critical to meet international sustainability standards and maintain global competitiveness. This master's study leverages Artificial Intelligence (AI) and Machine Learning (ML) methodologies to comprehensively analyze unstructured corporate data related to ESG practices among LEED-certified Bangladeshi T&A factories. Our study employs advanced techniques, including Web Scraping, Natural Language Processing (NLP), and Topic Modeling, to extract and analyze sustainability-related information from factory websites. We develop a robust ML framework that utilizes Non-Negative Matrix Factorization (NMF) for topic extraction and a Random Forest classifier for ESG category prediction, achieving an 86% classification accuracy. The study uncovers four key ESG themes: Environmental Sustainability, Social : Workplace Safety and Compliance, Social: Education and Community Programs, and Governance. The analysis reveals that 46% of factories prioritize environmental initiatives, such as energy conservation and waste management, while 44% emphasize social aspects, including workplace safety and education. Governance practices are significantly underrepresented, with only 10% of companies addressing ethical governance, healthcare provisions and employee welfare. To deepen our understanding of the ESG themes, we conducted a Centrality Analysis to identify the most influential keywords within each category, using measures such as degree, closeness, and eigenvector centrality. Furthermore, our analysis reveals that higher certification levels, like Platinum, are associated with a more balanced emphasis on environmental, social, and governance practices, while lower levels focus primarily on environmental efforts. These insights highlight key areas where the industry can improve and inform targeted strategies for enhancing ESG practices. Overall, this ML framework provides a data-driven, scalable approach for analyzing unstructured corporate data and promoting sustainability in Bangladesh\u2019s T&A sector, offering actionable recommendations for industry stakeholders, policymakers, and global brands committed to responsible sourcing. Samyoga Bhattarai \u2018Pro-ID: A Secure Face Recognition System using Locality Sensitive Hashing to Protect Human ID\u2019 When & Where: Monday, December 9, 2024 - 3:00 PM Eaton Hall, Room 2001B Committee Members: Sumaiya Shomaji, Chair Tamzidul Hoque Hongyang Sun Abstract Face recognition systems are widely used in various applications, from mobile banking apps to personal smartphones. However, these systems often store biometric templates in raw form, posing significant security and privacy risks. Pro-ID addresses this vulnerability by incorporating SimHash, an algorithm of Locality Sensitive Hashing (LSH), to create secure and irreversible hash codes of facial feature vectors. Unlike traditional methods that leave raw data exposed to potential breaches, SimHash transforms the feature space into high-dimensional hash codes, safeguarding user identity while preserving system functionality. The proposed system creates a balance between two aspects: security and the system\u2019s performance. Additionally, the system is designed to resist common attacks, including brute force and template inversion, ensuring that even if the hashed templates are exposed, the original biometric data cannot be reconstructed. A key challenge addressed in this project is minimizing the trade-off between security and performance. Extensive evaluations demonstrate that the proposed method maintains competitive accuracy rates comparable to traditional face recognition systems while significantly enhancing security metrics such as irreversibility, unlinkability, and revocability. This innovative approach contributes to advancing the reliability and trustworthiness of biometric systems, providing a secure framework for applications in face recognition systems. Shalmoli Ghosh High-Power Fabry-Perot Quantum-Well Laser Diodes for Application in Multi-Channel Coherent Optical Communication Systems When & Where: Friday, December 6, 2024 - 1:00 PM Nichols Hall, Room 246 (Executive Conference Room) Committee Members: Rongqing Hui , Chair Shannon Blunt Jim Stiles Abstract Wavelength Division Multiplexing (WDM) is essential for managing rapid network traffic growth in fiber optic systems. Each WDM channel demands a narrow-linewidth, frequency-stabilized laser diode, leading to complexity and increased energy consumption. Multi-wavelength laser sources, generating optical frequency combs (OFC), offer an attractive solution, enabling a single laser diode to provide numerous equally spaced spectral lines for enhanced bandwidth efficiency. Quantum-dot and quantum-dash OFCs provide phase-synchronized lines with low relative intensity noise (RIN), while Quantum Well (QW) OFCs offer higher power efficiency, but they have higher RIN in the low frequency region of up to 2 GHz. However, both quantum-dot/dash and QW based OFCs, individual spectral lines exhibit high phase noise, limiting coherent detection. Output power levels of these OFCs range between 1-20 mW where the power of each spectral line is typically less than -5 dBm. Due to this requirement, these OFCs require excessive optical amplification, also they possess relatively broad spectral linewidths of each spectral line, due to the inverse relationship between optical power and linewidth as per the Schawlow-Townes formula. This constraint hampers their applicability in coherent detection systems, highlighting a challenge for achieving high-performance optical communication. In this work, coherent system application of a single-section Quantum-Well Fabry-Perot (FP) laser diode is demonstrated. This laser delivers over 120 mW optical power at the fiber pigtail with a mode spacing of 36.14 GHz. In an experimental setup, 20 spectral lines from a single laser transmitter carry 30 GBaud 16-QAM signals over 78.3 km single-mode fiber, achieving significant data transmission rates. With the potential to support a transmission capacity of 2.15 Tb/s (4.3 Tb/s for dual polarization) per transmitter, including Forward Error Correction (FEC) and maintenance overhead, it offers a promising solution for meeting the escalating demands of modern network traffic efficiently. TJ Barclay Proof-Producing Translation from Gallina to CakeML When & Where: Friday, December 6, 2024 - 12:00 PM Nichols Hall, Room 250 (Gemini Room) Committee Members: Perry Alexander, Chair Alex Bardas Drew Davidson Sankha Guria Eileen Nutting Abstract Users of theorem provers often desire to to extract their verified code to a more efficient, compiled language. Coq's current extraction mechanism provides this facility but does not provide a formal guarantee that the extracted code has the same semantics as the logic it is extracted from. Providing such a guarantee requires a formal semantics for the target code. The CakeML project, implemented in HOL4, provides a formally defined syntax and semantics for a subset of SML and includes a proof-producing translator from higher-order logic to CakeML. We use the CakeML definition to develop a certifying extractor to CakeML from Gallina using the translation and proof techniques of the HOL4 CakeML translator. We also address how differences between HOL4 (higher-order logic) and Coq (calculus of constructions) effect the implementation details of the Coq translator. Anissa Khan Privacy Preserving Biometric Matching When & Where: Wednesday, December 4, 2024 - 3:00 PM Eaton Hall, Room 2001B Committee Members: Perry Alexander, Chair Prasad Kulkarni Fengjun Li Abstract Biometric matching is a process by which distinct features are used to identify an individual. Doing so privately is important because biometric data, such as fingerprints or facial features, is not something that can be easily changed or updated if put at risk. In this study, we perform a piece of the biometric matching process in a privacy preserving manner by using secure multiparty computation (SMPC). Using SMPC allows the identifying biological data, called a template, to remain stored by the data owner during the matching process. This provides security guarantees to the biological data while it is in use and therefore reduces the chances the data is stolen. In this study, we find that performing biometric matching using SMPC is just as accurate as performing the same match in plaintext.",

Fatima Al-Shaikhli Optical Fiber Measurements: Leveraging Coherent FMCW Techniques When & Where: Monday, April 28, 2025 - 2:00 PM Nichols Hall, Room 246 (Executive Conference Room) Committee Members: Rongqing Hui, Chair Shannon Blunt Shima Fardad Alessandro Salandrino Judy Wu Abstract Recent advancements in optical fiber technology have proven to be invaluable in a variety of fields, extending far beyond high-speed communications. These innovations enable optical fiber sensing, which plays a critical role across diverse applications, from medical diagnostics to infrastructure monitoring and automotive systems. This research focuses on leveraging commercially available coherent optical transceiver systems to develop novel measurement techniques for characterizing optical fiber properties. Specifically, our goal is to leverage a digitally chirped frequency-modulated continuous wave (FMCW) to extract detailed information about optical fiber characteristics, as well as target range. Through this approach, we aim to enable more accurate and fast assessments of fiber performance and integrity, while exploring the potential for utilizing existing optical communication networks to enhance fiber characterization capabilities. This goal is investigated through three distinct projects: (1) fiber type characterization based on intensity-modulated electrostriction response, (2) self-homodyne coherent Light Detection and Ranging (LiDAR) system for target range and velocity detection, and (3) birefringence measurements using a coherent Polarization-sensitive Optical Frequency Domain Reflectometer (OFDR) system. Electrostriction in an optical fiber is introduced by interaction between the forward propagated optical signal and the acoustic standing waves in the radial direction resonating between the center of the core and the cladding circumference of the fiber. The response of electrostriction is dependent on fiber parameters, especially the mode field radius. We demonstrated a novel technique of identifying fiber types through the measurement of intensity modulation induced electrostriction response. As the spectral envelope of electrostriction induced propagation loss is anti-symmetrical, the signal to noise ratio can be significantly increased by subtracting the measured spectrum from its complex conjugate. We show that if the field distribution of the fiber propagation mode is Gaussian, the envelope of the electrostriction-induced loss spectrum closely follows a Maxwellian distribution whose shape can be specified by a single parameter determined by the mode field radius. We also present a self-homodyne FMCW LiDAR system based on a coherent receiver. By using the same linearly chirped waveform for both the LiDAR signal and the local oscillator, the self-homodyne coherent receiver performs frequency de-chirping directly in the photodiodes, significantly simplifying signal processing. As a result, the required receiver bandwidth is much lower than the chirping bandwidth of the signal. Multi-target detection is demonstrated experimentally, and while only amplitude modulation is required in the LiDAR transmitter, the phase-diversity coherent receiver enables simultaneous detection of both range and velocity for each target, along with the sign of the target\u2019s velocity. In addition, we demonstrate a polarization-sensitive OFDR system utilizing a commercially available digital coherent optical transceiver to generate a linear frequency chirp via carrier-suppressed single-sideband modulation. This method ensures linearity in chirping and phase continuity of the optical carrier. The coherent homodyne receiver, incorporating both polarization and phase diversity, recovers the state of polarization (SOP) of the backscattered optical signal along the fiber, mixing with an identically chirped local oscillator. With a spatial resolution of approximately , a chirping bandwidth, and a measurement time, this system enables precise birefringence measurements. By employing three mutually orthogonal SOPs of the launched optical signal, we can measure birefringence vectors along the fiber, providing not only the magnitude of birefringence but also the direction of any external pressure applied to the fiber. Liangqin Ren Understanding and Mitigating Security Risks towards Trustworthy Deep Learning Systems When & Where: Tuesday, April 22, 2025 - 9:00 AM Nichols Hall, Room 250 (Gemini Room) Committee Members: Fengjun Li, Chair Drew Davidson Bo Luo Zijun Yao Xinmai Yang Abstract Deep learning is widely used in healthcare, finance, and other critical domains, raising concerns about system trustworthiness. However, deep learning models and data still face three types of critical attacks: model theft, identity impersonation, and abuse of AI-generated content (AIGC). To address model theft, homomorphic encryption has been explored for privacy-preserving inference, but it remains highly inefficient. To counter identity impersonation, prior work focuses on detection, disruption, and tracing\u2014yet fails to protect source and target images simultaneously. To prevent AIGC abuse, methods like evaluation, watermarking, and machine unlearning exist, but text-driven image editing remains largely unprotected. This report addresses the above challenges through three key designs. First, to enable privacy-preserving inference while accelerating homomorphic encryption, we propose PrivDNN, which selectively encrypts the most critical model parameters, significantly reducing encrypted operations. We design a selection score to evaluate neuron importance and use a greedy algorithm to iteratively secure the most impactful neurons. Across four models and datasets, PrivDNN reduces encrypted operations by 85%\u201398%, and cuts inference time and memory usage by over 97% while preserving accuracy and privacy. Second, to counter identity impersonation in deepfake face-swapping, where both the source and target can be exploited, we introduce PhantomSeal, which embeds invisible perturbations to encode a hidden\u00a0\u201ccloak\u201d identity. When used as a target, the resulting content displays visible artifacts; when used as a source, the generated deepfake is altered to resemble the cloak identity. Evaluations across two generations of deepfake face-swapping show that PhantomSeal reduces attack success from 97% to 0.8%, with 95% of outputs recognized as the cloak identity, providing robust protection against manipulation. Third, to prevent AIGC abuse, we construct a comprehensive dataset, perform large-scale human evaluation, and establish a benchmark for detecting AI-generated artwork to better understand abuse risks in AI-generated content. Building on this direction, we propose Protecting Copyright against Image Editing (PCIE) to address copyright infringement in text-driven image editing. PCIE embeds an invisible copyright mark into the original image, which transforms into a visible watermark after text-driven editing to automatically reveal ownership upon unauthorized modification. Andrew Stratmann Efficient Index-Based Multi-User Scheduling for Mobile mmWave Networks: Balancing Channel Quality and User Experience When & Where: Monday, April 21, 2025 - 2:00 PM Eaton Hall, Room 2001B Committee Members: Morteza Hashemi, Chair Prasad Kulkarni Erik Perrins Abstract Millimeter Wave (mmWave) communication technologies have the potential to establish high data rates for next-generation wireless networks, as well as enable novel applications that were previously untenable due to high throughput requirements. \u00a0Yet reliable and efficient mmWave communication remains challenged by intermittent link quality due to user mobility and frequent line-of-sight (LoS) blockage, thereby making the links unavailable or more costly to use. \u00a0These factors are further exacerbated in multi-user settings where beam alignment overhead, limited RF chains, and heterogeneous user requirements must be balanced. \u00a0In this work, we present a hybrid multi-user scheduling solution that jointly accounts for mobility-and blockage-induced unavailability to enhance user experience in mmWave video streaming applications. \u00a0Our approach integrates two key components: (i) a blockage-aware scheduling strategy modeled via a Restless Multi-Armed Bandit (RMAB) formulation and prioritized using Whittle Indexing, and (ii) a mobility-aware geometric model that estimates beam alignment overhead cost as a function of receiver motion. \u00a0We develop a comprehensive and efficient index-based scheduler that fuses these models and leverages contextual information, such as receiver distance, mobility history, and queue state, to schedule multiple users in order to maximize throughput. Simulation results demonstrate that our approach reduces system queue backlog and improves fairness compared to round-robin and traditional index-based baselines. Tianxiao Zhang Efficient and Effective Object Detection and Recognition: from Convolutions to Transformers When & Where: Thursday, April 17, 2025 - 9:30 AM Eaton Hall, Room 2001B Committee Members: Bo Luo, Chair Prasad Kulkarni Fengjun Li Cuncong Zhong Guanghui Wang Abstract With the development of Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs), computer vision has entered a new era, significantly enhancing the performance of tasks such as image classification, object detection, segmentation, and recognition. Furthermore, the introduction of Transformer architectures has brought the attention mechanism and a global perspective to computer vision, advancing the field to a new level. The inductive bias inherent in CNNs makes convolutional models particularly well-suited for processing images and videos. On the other hand, the attention mechanism in Transformer models allows them to capture global relationships between tokens. While Transformers often require more data and longer training periods compared to their convolutional counterparts, they have the potential to achieve comparable or even superior performance when the constraints of data availability and training time are mitigated. In this work, we propose more efficient and effective CNNs and Transformers to increase the performance of object detection and recognition. (1) A novel approach is proposed for real-time detection and tracking of small golf balls by combining object detection with the Kalman filter. Several classical object detection models were implemented and compared in terms of detection precision and speed. (2) To address the domain shift problem in object detection, we employ generative adversarial networks (GANs) to generate images from different domains. The original RGB images are concatenated with the corresponding GAN-generated images to form a 6-channel representation, improving model performance across domains. (3) A dynamic strategy for improving label assignment in modern object detection models is proposed. Rather than relying on fixed or statistics-based adaptive thresholds, a dynamic paradigm is introduced to define positive and negative samples. This allows more high-quality samples to be selected as positives, reducing the gap between classification and IoU scores and producing more accurate bounding boxes. (4) An efficient hybrid architecture combining Vision Transformers and convolutional layers is introduced for object recognition, particularly for small datasets. Lightweight depth-wise convolution modules bypass the entire Transformer block to capture local details that the Transformer backbone might overlook. The majority of the computations and parameters remain within the Transformer architecture, resulting in significantly improved performance with minimal overhead. (5) An innovative Multi-Overlapped-Head Self-Attention mechanism is introduced to enhance information exchange between heads in the Multi-Head Self-Attention mechanism of Vision Transformers. By overlapping adjacent heads during self-attention computation, information can flow between heads, leading to further improvements in vision recognition. Faris El-Katri Source Separation using Sparse Bayesian Learning When & Where: Wednesday, April 16, 2025 - 3:00 PM Eaton Hall, Room 2001B Committee Members: Patrick McCormick, Chair Shannon Blunt James Stiles Abstract Wireless communication in recent decades has allowed for a substantial increase in both the speed and capacity of information which may be transmitted over large distances. However, given the expanding societal needs coupled with a finite available spectrum, the question arises of how to increase the efficiency by which information may be transmitted. One natural answer to this question lies in spectrum sharing\u2014that is, in allowing multiple noncooperative agents to inhabit the same spectrum bands. In order to achieve this, we must be able to reliably separate the desired signals from those of other agents in the background. However, since our agents are noncooperative, we must develop a model-agnostic approach at tackling this problem. For this work, we will consider cohabitation between radar signals and communication signals, with the former being the desired signal and the latter being the noncooperative agent. In order to approach such problems involving highly underdetermined linear systems, we propose utilizing Sparse Bayesian Learning and present our results on selected problems. Bryan Richlinski Prioritize Program Diversity: Enumerative Synthesis with Entropy Ordering When & Where: Tuesday, December 3, 2024 - 1:00 PM Nichols Hall, Room 246 (Executive Conference Room) Committee Members: Sankha Guria, Chair Perry Alexander Drew Davidson Jennifer Lohoefener Abstract Program synthesis is a popular way to create a correct-by-construction program from a user-provided specification. Term enumeration is a leading technique to systematically explore the space of programs by generating terms from a formal grammar. These terms are treated as candidate programs which are tested/verified against the specification for correctness. In order to prioritize candidates more likely to satisfy the specification, enumeration is often ordered by program size or other domain-specific heuristics. However, domain-specific heuristics require expert knowledge, and enumeration by size often leads to terms comprised of frequently repeating symbols that are less likely to satisfy a specification. In this thesis, we build a heuristic that prioritizes term enumeration based on variability of individual symbols in the program, i.e., information entropy of the program. We use this heuristic to order programs in both top-down and bottom-up enumeration. We evaluated our work on a subset of the PBE-String track of the 2017 SyGuS competition benchmarks and compared against size-based enumeration. Top-down enumeration guided by entropy expands upon fewer partial expressions than naive in 77\\% of benchmarks, and tests fewer complete expressions in 54\\%, resulting in improved synthesis time in 40\\% of benchmarks. However, 71\\% of benchmarks in bottom-up enumeration using entropy tests fewer expressions than naive enumeration, without any improvements to the running time. We conclude entropy is a promising direction to prioritize candidates during program search in enumerative synthesis, and propose a future directions for improving performance of our proposed techniques. Elizabeth Wyss A New Frontier for Software Security: Diving Deep into npm When & Where: Tuesday, December 3, 2024 - 9:00 AM Eaton Hall, Room 2001B Committee Members: Drew Davidson, Chair Alex Bardas Fengjun Li Bo Luo J. Walker Abstract Open-source package managers (e.g., npm for Node.js) have become an established component of modern software development. Rather than creating applications from scratch, developers may employ modular software dependencies and frameworks--called packages --to serve as building blocks for writing larger applications. Package managers make this process easy. With a simple command line directive, developers are able to quickly fetch and install packages across vast open-source repositories. npm--the largest of such repositories--alone hosts millions of unique packages and serves billions of package downloads each week. However, the widespread code sharing resulting from open-source package managers also presents novel security implications. Vulnerable or malicious code hiding deep within package dependency trees can be leveraged downstream to attack both software developers and the users of their applications. This downstream flow of software dependencies--dubbed the software supply chain --is critical to secure. This research provides a deep dive into the npm-centric software supply chain, exploring various facets and phenomena that impact the security of this software supply chain. Such factors include (i) hidden code clones--which obscure provenance and can stealthily propagate known vulnerabilities, (ii) install-time attacks enabled by unmediated installation scripts, (iii) hard-coded URLs residing in package code, (iv) the impacts open-source development practices, and (v) package compromise via malicious updates. For each facet, tooling is presented to identify and/or mitigate potential security impacts. Ultimately, it is our hope that this research fosters greater awareness, deeper understanding, and further efforts to forge a new frontier for the security of modern software supply chains. Jagadeesh Sai Dokku Intelligent Chat Bot for KU Website: Automated Query Response and Resource Navigation When & Where: Monday, December 2, 2024 - 12:00 PM Eaton Hall, Room 2001B Committee Members: David Johnson, Chair Prasad Kulkarni Hongyang Sun Abstract This project introduces an intelligent chatbot designed to improve user experience on our university website by providing instant, automated responses to common inquiries. Navigating a university website can be challenging for students, applicants, and visitors who seek quick information about admissions, campus services, events, and more. To address this challenge, we developed a chatbot that simulates human conversation using Natural Language Processing (NLP), allowing users to find information more efficiently. The chatbot is powered by a Bidirectional Long Short-Term Memory (BiLSTM) model, an architecture well-suited for understanding complex sentence structures. This model captures contextual information from both directions in a sentence, enabling it to identify user intent with high accuracy. We trained the chatbot on a dataset of intent-labeled queries, enabling it to recognize specific intentions such as asking about campus facilities, academic programs, or event schedules. The NLP pipeline includes steps like tokenization, lemmatization, and vectorization. Tokenization and lemmatization prepare the text by breaking it into manageable units and standardizing word forms, making it easier for the model to recognize similar word patterns. The vectorization process then translates this processed text into numerical data that the model can interpret. Flask is used to manage the backend, allowing seamless communication between the user interface and the BiLSTM model. When a user submits a query, Flask routes the input to the model, processes the prediction, and delivers the appropriate response back to the user interface. This chatbot demonstrates a successful application of NLP in creating interactive, efficient, and user-friendly solutions. By automating responses, it reduces reliance on manual support and ensures users can access relevant information at any time. This project highlights how intelligent chatbots can transform the way users interact with university websites, offering a faster and more engaging experience. Anahita Memar Optimizing Protein Particle Classification: A Study on Smoothing Techniques and Model Performance When & Where: Tuesday, November 26, 2024 - 11:00 AM Eaton Hall, Room 2001B Committee Members: Prasad Kulkarni, Chair Hossein Saiedian Prajna Dhar Abstract This thesis investigates the impact of smoothing techniques on enhancing classification accuracy in protein particle datasets, focusing on both binary and multi-class configurations across three datasets. By applying methods including Averaging-Based Smoothing, Moving Average, Exponential Smoothing, Savitzky-Golay, and Kalman Smoothing, we sought to improve performance in Random Forest, Decision Tree, and Neural Network models. Initial baseline accuracies revealed the complexity of multi-class separability, while clustering analyses provided valuable insights into class similarities and distinctions, guiding our interpretation of classification challenges. These results indicate that Averaging-Based Smoothing and Moving Average techniques are particularly effective in enhancing classification accuracy, especially in configurations with marked differences in surfactant conditions. Feature importance analysis identified critical metrics, such as IntMean and IntMax, which played a significant role in distinguishing classes. Cross-validation validated the robustness of our models, with Random Forest and Neural Network consistently outperforming others in binary tasks and showing promising adaptability in multi-class classification. This study not only highlights the efficacy of smoothing techniques for improving classification in protein particle analysis but also offers a foundational approach for future research in biopharmaceutical data processing and analysis. Yousif Dafalla Web-Armour: Mitigating Reconnaissance and Vulnerability Scanning with Injecting Scan-Impeding Delays in Web Deployments When & Where: Friday, November 22, 2024 - 12:00 PM Nichols Hall, Room 246 (Executive Conference Room) Committee Members: Alex Bardas, Chair Drew Davidson Fengjun Li Bo Luo ZJ Wang Abstract Scanning hosts on the internet for vulnerable devices and services is a key step in numerous cyberattacks. Previous work has shown that scanning is a widespread phenomenon on the internet and commonly targets web application/server deployments.\u00a0Given that automated scanning is a crucial step in many cyberattacks, it would be beneficial to make it more difficult for adversaries to perform such activity. In this work, we propose Web-Armour, a mitigation approach to adversarial reconnaissance and vulnerability scanning of web deployments. The proposed approach relies on injecting scanning impeding delays to infrequently or rarely used portions of a web deployment.\u00a0Web-Armour has two goals: First, increase the cost for attackers to perform automated reconnaissance and vulnerability scanning; Second, introduce minimal to negligible performance overhead to benign users of the deployment. We evaluate Web-Armour on live environments, operated by real users, and on different controlled (offline) scenarios. We show that Web-Armour can\u00a0effectively lead to thwarting reconnaissance and internet-wide scanning. Kabir Panahi A Security Analysis of the Integration of Biometric Technology in the 2019 Afghan Presidential Election When & Where: Tuesday, November 12, 2024 - 8:30 AM Nichols Hall, Room 250 (Gemini Room) Committee Members: Alex Bardas, Chair Drew Davidson Fengjun Li Bo Luo Abstract Afghanistan deployed Biometric Voter Verification (BVV) technology nationally for the first time in the 2019 presidential election to address the systematic frauds in the prior elections. Through semi-structure interviews with 18 key national and international stakeholders who had an active role in this election, this study investigates the gap between intended outcomes of the BVV technology\u2014focused on voter enfranchisement, fraud prevention, and public trust\u2014and the reality on election day and beyond within the unique socio-political and technical landscape of Afghanistan. Our findings reveal that while BVV technology initially promised a secure and transparent election, various technical and implementation challenges emerged, including threats for voters, staff, and officials. We found that the BVVs both supported and violated electoral goals: while they helped reduce fraud, they inadvertently disenfranchised some voters and caused delays that affected public trust. Technical limitations, usability issues, and administrative misalignments contributed to these outcomes. This study recommends critical lessons for future implementations of electoral technologies, emphasizing the importance of context-aware technological solutions and the need for robust administrative and technical frameworks to fully realize the potential benefits of election technology in fragile democracies. Hara Madhav Talasila Radiometric Calibration of Radar Depth Sounder Data Products When & Where: Friday, November 8, 2024 - 12:30 PM Nichols Hall, Room 317 (Richard K. Moore Conference Room) Committee Members: Carl Leuschen, Chair Christopher Allen James Stiles Jilu Li Leigh Stearns Abstract Although the Center for Remote Sensing of Ice Sheets (CReSIS) performs several radar calibration steps to produce Operation IceBridge (OIB) radar depth sounder data products, these datasets are not radiometrically calibrated and the swath array processing uses ideal (rather than measured [calibrated]) steering vectors. Any errors in the steering vectors, which describe the response of the radar as a function of arrival angle, will lead to errors in positioning and backscatter that subsequently affect estimates of basal conditions, ice thickness, and radar attenuation. Scientific applications that estimate physical characteristics of surface and subsurface targets from the backscatter are limited with the current data because it is not absolutely calibrated. Moreover, changes in instrument hardware and processing methods for OIB over the last decade affect the quality of inter-seasonal comparisons. Recent methods which interpret basal conditions and calculate radar attenuation using CReSIS OIB 2D radar depth sounder echograms are forced to use relative scattering power, rather than absolute methods. As an active target calibration is not possible for past field seasons, a method that uses natural targets will be developed. Unsaturated natural target returns from smooth sea-ice leads or lakes are imaged in many datasets and have known scattering responses. The proposed method forms a system of linear equations with the recorded scattering signatures from these known targets, scattering signatures from crossing flight paths, and the radiometric correction terms. A least squares solution to optimize the radiometric correction terms is calculated, which minimizes the error function representing the mismatch in expected and measured scattering. The new correction terms will be used to correct the remaining mission data. The radar depth sounder data from all OIB campaigns can be reprocessed to produce absolutely calibrated echograms for the Arctic and Antarctic. A software simulator will be developed to study calibration errors and verify the calibration software. The software for processing natural targets and crossovers will be made available in CReSIS\u2019s open-source polar radar software toolbox. The OIB data will be reprocessed with new calibration terms, providing to the data user community a complete set of radiometrically calibrated radar echograms for the CReSIS OIB radar depth sounder for the first time. Daniel Herr Information Theoretic Waveform Design with Application to Physically Realizable Adaptive-on-Transmit Radar When & Where: Tuesday, October 8, 2024 - 2:45 PM Nichols Hall, Room 129 (Ron Evans Apollo Auditorium) Committee Members: James Stiles, Chair Christopher Allen Carl Leuschen Chris Depcik Abstract The fundamental task of a radar system is to utilize the electromagnetic spectrum to sense a scattering environment and generate some estimate from this measurement. This task can be posed as a Bayesian estimation problem of random parameters (the scattering environment) through an imperfect sensor (the radar system). From this viewpoint, metrics such as error covariance and estimator precision (or information) can be leveraged to evaluate and improve the performance of radar systems. Here, physically realizable radar waveforms are designed to maximize the Fisher information (FI) (specifically, a derivative of FI known as marginal Fisher information (MFI)) extracted from a scattering environment thereby minimizing the expected error covariance about an estimation parameter space. This information theoretic framework, along with the high-degree of design flexibility afforded by fully digital transmitter and receiver architectures, creates a high-dimensionality design space for optimizing radar performance. First, the problem of joint-domain range-Doppler estimation utilizing a pulse-agile radar is posed from an estimation theoretic framework, and the minimum mean square error (MMSE) estimator is shown to suppress the range-sidelobe modulation (RSM) induced by pulse agility which may improve the signal-to-interference-plus-noise ratio (SINR) in signal-limited scenarios. A computationally efficient implementation of the range-Doppler MMSE estimator is developed as a series of range-profile estimation problems, under specific modeling and statistical assumptions. Next, a transformation of the estimation parameterization is introduced which ameliorates the high noise-gain typically associated with traditional MMSE estimation by sacrificing the super-resolution achieved by the MMSE estimator. Then, coordinate descent and gradient descent optimization methods are developed for designing MFI optimal waveforms with respect to either the original or transformed estimation space. These MFI optimal waveforms are extended to provide pulse-agility, which produces high-dimensionality radar emissions amenable to non-traditional receive processing techniques (such as MMSE estimation). Finally, informationally optimal waveform design and optimal estimation are extended into a cognitive radar concept capable of adaptive and dynamic sensing. The efficacy of the MFI waveform design and MMSE estimation are demonstrated via open-air hardware experimentation where their performance is compared against traditional techniques Matthew Heintzelman Spatially Diverse Radar Techniques - Emission Optimization and Enhanced Receive Processing When & Where: Thursday, September 19, 2024 - 10:00 AM Nichols Hall, Room 129 (Ron Evans Apollo Auditorium) Committee Members: Shannon Blunt, Chair Christopher Allen Patrick McCormick James Stiles Zsolt Talata Abstract Radar systems perform 3 basic tasks: search/detection, tracking, and imaging. Traditionally, varied operational and hardware requirements have compartmentalized these functions to distinct and specialized radars, which may communicate actionable information between them. Expedited by the growth in computational capabilities modeled by Moore\u2019s law, next-generation radars will be sophisticated, multi-function systems comprising generalized and reprogrammable subsystems. The advance of fully Digital Array Radars (DAR) has enabled the implementation of highly directive phased arrays that can scan, detect, and track scatterers through a volume-of-interest. Conversely, DAR technology has also enabled Multiple-Input Multiple-Output (MIMO) radar methodologies that seek to illuminate all space on transmit, while forming separate but simultaneous, directive beams on receive. Waveform diversity has been repeatedly proven to enhance radar operation through added Degrees-of-Freedom (DoF) that can be leveraged to expand dynamic range, provide ambiguity resolution, and improve parameter estimation.\u00a0 In particular, diversity among the DAR\u2019s transmitting elements provides flexibility to the emission, allowing simultaneous multi-function capability. By precise design of the emission, the DAR can utilize the operationally-continuous trade-space between a fully coherent phased array and a fully incoherent MIMO system. This flexibility could enable the optimal management of the radar\u2019s resources, where Signal-to-Noise Ratio (SNR) would be traded for robustness in detection, measurement capability, and tracking. Waveform diversity is herein leveraged as the predominant enabling technology for multi-function radar emission design. Three methods of emission optimization are considered to design distinct beams in space and frequency, according to classical error minimization techniques. First, a gradient-based optimization of the Space-Frequency Template Error (SFTE) is applied to a high-fidelity model for a wideband array\u2019s far-field emission. Second, a more efficient optimization is considered, based on the SFTE for narrowband arrays. Finally, a suboptimal solution, based on alternating projections, is shown to provide rapidly reconfigurable transmit patterns. To improve the dynamic range observed for MIMO radars employing pulse-agile quasi-orthogonal waveforms, a pulse-compression model is derived that manages to suppress both autocorrelation sidelobes and multi-transmitter-induced cross-correlation. The proposed waveforms and filters are implemented in hardware to demonstrate performance, validate robustness, and reflect real-world application to the degree possible with laboratory experimentation. Anjana Lamsal Self-homodyne Coherent Lidar System for Range and Velocity Detection When & Where: Thursday, August 29, 2024 - 2:00 PM Nichols Hall, Room 246 (Executive Conference Room) Committee Members: Rongqing Hui, Chair Alessandro Salandrino James Stiles Abstract Lidar systems are gaining popularity due to their benefits, including high resolution, precise accuracy and scalability. An FMCW lidar based on self-homodyne coherent detection technique is used for range and velocity measurement with a phase diverse coherent receiver. The system employs a self-homodyne detection technique, where a LO signal is derived directly from the same laser source as the transmitted signal and is the same linear chirp as the transmitted signal, thereby minimizing phase noise. A coherent receiver is employed to get in-phase and quadrature components of the photocurrent and to perform de-chirping. Since the LO has the same chirp as the transmitted signal, the mixing process in the photodiodes effectively cancels out the chirp or frequency modulation from the received signal. The spectrum of the de-chirped complex waveform is used to determine the range and velocity of the target. This lidar system simplifies the signal processing by using photodetectors for de-chirping. Additionally, after de-chirping, the resulting signal has a much narrower bandwidth compared to the original chirp signal and signal processing can be performed at lower frequencies.",

Fatima Al-Shaikhli Optical Fiber Measurements: Leveraging Coherent FMCW Techniques When & Where: Monday, April 28, 2025 - 2:00 PM Nichols Hall, Room 246 (Executive Conference Room) Committee Members: Rongqing Hui, Chair Shannon Blunt Shima Fardad Alessandro Salandrino Judy Wu Abstract Recent advancements in optical fiber technology have proven to be invaluable in a variety of fields, extending far beyond high-speed communications. These innovations enable optical fiber sensing, which plays a critical role across diverse applications, from medical diagnostics to infrastructure monitoring and automotive systems. This research focuses on leveraging commercially available coherent optical transceiver systems to develop novel measurement techniques for characterizing optical fiber properties. Specifically, our goal is to leverage a digitally chirped frequency-modulated continuous wave (FMCW) to extract detailed information about optical fiber characteristics, as well as target range. Through this approach, we aim to enable more accurate and fast assessments of fiber performance and integrity, while exploring the potential for utilizing existing optical communication networks to enhance fiber characterization capabilities. This goal is investigated through three distinct projects: (1) fiber type characterization based on intensity-modulated electrostriction response, (2) self-homodyne coherent Light Detection and Ranging (LiDAR) system for target range and velocity detection, and (3) birefringence measurements using a coherent Polarization-sensitive Optical Frequency Domain Reflectometer (OFDR) system. Electrostriction in an optical fiber is introduced by interaction between the forward propagated optical signal and the acoustic standing waves in the radial direction resonating between the center of the core and the cladding circumference of the fiber. The response of electrostriction is dependent on fiber parameters, especially the mode field radius. We demonstrated a novel technique of identifying fiber types through the measurement of intensity modulation induced electrostriction response. As the spectral envelope of electrostriction induced propagation loss is anti-symmetrical, the signal to noise ratio can be significantly increased by subtracting the measured spectrum from its complex conjugate. We show that if the field distribution of the fiber propagation mode is Gaussian, the envelope of the electrostriction-induced loss spectrum closely follows a Maxwellian distribution whose shape can be specified by a single parameter determined by the mode field radius. We also present a self-homodyne FMCW LiDAR system based on a coherent receiver. By using the same linearly chirped waveform for both the LiDAR signal and the local oscillator, the self-homodyne coherent receiver performs frequency de-chirping directly in the photodiodes, significantly simplifying signal processing. As a result, the required receiver bandwidth is much lower than the chirping bandwidth of the signal. Multi-target detection is demonstrated experimentally, and while only amplitude modulation is required in the LiDAR transmitter, the phase-diversity coherent receiver enables simultaneous detection of both range and velocity for each target, along with the sign of the target\u2019s velocity. In addition, we demonstrate a polarization-sensitive OFDR system utilizing a commercially available digital coherent optical transceiver to generate a linear frequency chirp via carrier-suppressed single-sideband modulation. This method ensures linearity in chirping and phase continuity of the optical carrier. The coherent homodyne receiver, incorporating both polarization and phase diversity, recovers the state of polarization (SOP) of the backscattered optical signal along the fiber, mixing with an identically chirped local oscillator. With a spatial resolution of approximately , a chirping bandwidth, and a measurement time, this system enables precise birefringence measurements. By employing three mutually orthogonal SOPs of the launched optical signal, we can measure birefringence vectors along the fiber, providing not only the magnitude of birefringence but also the direction of any external pressure applied to the fiber. Liangqin Ren Understanding and Mitigating Security Risks towards Trustworthy Deep Learning Systems When & Where: Tuesday, April 22, 2025 - 9:00 AM Nichols Hall, Room 250 (Gemini Room) Committee Members: Fengjun Li, Chair Drew Davidson Bo Luo Zijun Yao Xinmai Yang Abstract Deep learning is widely used in healthcare, finance, and other critical domains, raising concerns about system trustworthiness. However, deep learning models and data still face three types of critical attacks: model theft, identity impersonation, and abuse of AI-generated content (AIGC). To address model theft, homomorphic encryption has been explored for privacy-preserving inference, but it remains highly inefficient. To counter identity impersonation, prior work focuses on detection, disruption, and tracing\u2014yet fails to protect source and target images simultaneously. To prevent AIGC abuse, methods like evaluation, watermarking, and machine unlearning exist, but text-driven image editing remains largely unprotected. This report addresses the above challenges through three key designs. First, to enable privacy-preserving inference while accelerating homomorphic encryption, we propose PrivDNN, which selectively encrypts the most critical model parameters, significantly reducing encrypted operations. We design a selection score to evaluate neuron importance and use a greedy algorithm to iteratively secure the most impactful neurons. Across four models and datasets, PrivDNN reduces encrypted operations by 85%\u201398%, and cuts inference time and memory usage by over 97% while preserving accuracy and privacy. Second, to counter identity impersonation in deepfake face-swapping, where both the source and target can be exploited, we introduce PhantomSeal, which embeds invisible perturbations to encode a hidden\u00a0\u201ccloak\u201d identity. When used as a target, the resulting content displays visible artifacts; when used as a source, the generated deepfake is altered to resemble the cloak identity. Evaluations across two generations of deepfake face-swapping show that PhantomSeal reduces attack success from 97% to 0.8%, with 95% of outputs recognized as the cloak identity, providing robust protection against manipulation. Third, to prevent AIGC abuse, we construct a comprehensive dataset, perform large-scale human evaluation, and establish a benchmark for detecting AI-generated artwork to better understand abuse risks in AI-generated content. Building on this direction, we propose Protecting Copyright against Image Editing (PCIE) to address copyright infringement in text-driven image editing. PCIE embeds an invisible copyright mark into the original image, which transforms into a visible watermark after text-driven editing to automatically reveal ownership upon unauthorized modification. Andrew Stratmann Efficient Index-Based Multi-User Scheduling for Mobile mmWave Networks: Balancing Channel Quality and User Experience When & Where: Monday, April 21, 2025 - 2:00 PM Eaton Hall, Room 2001B Committee Members: Morteza Hashemi, Chair Prasad Kulkarni Erik Perrins Abstract Millimeter Wave (mmWave) communication technologies have the potential to establish high data rates for next-generation wireless networks, as well as enable novel applications that were previously untenable due to high throughput requirements. \u00a0Yet reliable and efficient mmWave communication remains challenged by intermittent link quality due to user mobility and frequent line-of-sight (LoS) blockage, thereby making the links unavailable or more costly to use. \u00a0These factors are further exacerbated in multi-user settings where beam alignment overhead, limited RF chains, and heterogeneous user requirements must be balanced. \u00a0In this work, we present a hybrid multi-user scheduling solution that jointly accounts for mobility-and blockage-induced unavailability to enhance user experience in mmWave video streaming applications. \u00a0Our approach integrates two key components: (i) a blockage-aware scheduling strategy modeled via a Restless Multi-Armed Bandit (RMAB) formulation and prioritized using Whittle Indexing, and (ii) a mobility-aware geometric model that estimates beam alignment overhead cost as a function of receiver motion. \u00a0We develop a comprehensive and efficient index-based scheduler that fuses these models and leverages contextual information, such as receiver distance, mobility history, and queue state, to schedule multiple users in order to maximize throughput. Simulation results demonstrate that our approach reduces system queue backlog and improves fairness compared to round-robin and traditional index-based baselines. Tianxiao Zhang Efficient and Effective Object Detection and Recognition: from Convolutions to Transformers When & Where: Thursday, April 17, 2025 - 9:30 AM Eaton Hall, Room 2001B Committee Members: Bo Luo, Chair Prasad Kulkarni Fengjun Li Cuncong Zhong Guanghui Wang Abstract With the development of Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs), computer vision has entered a new era, significantly enhancing the performance of tasks such as image classification, object detection, segmentation, and recognition. Furthermore, the introduction of Transformer architectures has brought the attention mechanism and a global perspective to computer vision, advancing the field to a new level. The inductive bias inherent in CNNs makes convolutional models particularly well-suited for processing images and videos. On the other hand, the attention mechanism in Transformer models allows them to capture global relationships between tokens. While Transformers often require more data and longer training periods compared to their convolutional counterparts, they have the potential to achieve comparable or even superior performance when the constraints of data availability and training time are mitigated. In this work, we propose more efficient and effective CNNs and Transformers to increase the performance of object detection and recognition. (1) A novel approach is proposed for real-time detection and tracking of small golf balls by combining object detection with the Kalman filter. Several classical object detection models were implemented and compared in terms of detection precision and speed. (2) To address the domain shift problem in object detection, we employ generative adversarial networks (GANs) to generate images from different domains. The original RGB images are concatenated with the corresponding GAN-generated images to form a 6-channel representation, improving model performance across domains. (3) A dynamic strategy for improving label assignment in modern object detection models is proposed. Rather than relying on fixed or statistics-based adaptive thresholds, a dynamic paradigm is introduced to define positive and negative samples. This allows more high-quality samples to be selected as positives, reducing the gap between classification and IoU scores and producing more accurate bounding boxes. (4) An efficient hybrid architecture combining Vision Transformers and convolutional layers is introduced for object recognition, particularly for small datasets. Lightweight depth-wise convolution modules bypass the entire Transformer block to capture local details that the Transformer backbone might overlook. The majority of the computations and parameters remain within the Transformer architecture, resulting in significantly improved performance with minimal overhead. (5) An innovative Multi-Overlapped-Head Self-Attention mechanism is introduced to enhance information exchange between heads in the Multi-Head Self-Attention mechanism of Vision Transformers. By overlapping adjacent heads during self-attention computation, information can flow between heads, leading to further improvements in vision recognition. Faris El-Katri Source Separation using Sparse Bayesian Learning When & Where: Wednesday, April 16, 2025 - 3:00 PM Eaton Hall, Room 2001B Committee Members: Patrick McCormick, Chair Shannon Blunt James Stiles Abstract Wireless communication in recent decades has allowed for a substantial increase in both the speed and capacity of information which may be transmitted over large distances. However, given the expanding societal needs coupled with a finite available spectrum, the question arises of how to increase the efficiency by which information may be transmitted. One natural answer to this question lies in spectrum sharing\u2014that is, in allowing multiple noncooperative agents to inhabit the same spectrum bands. In order to achieve this, we must be able to reliably separate the desired signals from those of other agents in the background. However, since our agents are noncooperative, we must develop a model-agnostic approach at tackling this problem. For this work, we will consider cohabitation between radar signals and communication signals, with the former being the desired signal and the latter being the noncooperative agent. In order to approach such problems involving highly underdetermined linear systems, we propose utilizing Sparse Bayesian Learning and present our results on selected problems.

The paper \u201cDimension Reduction for Efficient Pattern Recognition in High Spatial Resolution Data Using Quantum Algorithms\u201d was nominated for the Best Paper Award at SOCC\u201919 and received second place. SOCC has been the premier forum for more than 30 years for publishing the latest advancements in System-On-Chip (SoC) architectures, systems, logic and circuit design, process technology, test, design tools and applications. \u201cI am proud of my student\u2019s hard work and I am pleased that the quality of our results have been recognized by this conference,\u201d Professor El-Araby said. Photo from left to right: senior Bailey\u00a0Srimoungchanh, Ph.D. student Naveed Mahmud, junior Nolan Blankenau, Assistant Professor Esam El-Araby, senior Bennett Haase-Divine, senior Annika Kuhnke, and junior Apurva Rai. Because of the immaturity and the high-cost of existing quantum technologies, El-Araby\u2019s research group has focused on developing a cost-effective and reconfigurable emulation platform that can be used for interfacing classical-to-quantum (C2Q) and quantum-to-classical (Q2C) data conversions between classical and quantum systems, and evaluating the performance of quantum algorithms for practical real-world quantum machine learning (QML) and cybersecurity applications. Their emulation platform architecture uses advanced field-programmable gate array (FPGA) technology for scalable, high performance, high throughput and highly accurate emulation of quantum algorithms and systems. Compared to existing state-of-the-art FPGA emulators, this emulation framework is the highest scalable, most accurate, and achieves highest throughput, as demonstrated by encouraging experimental results.",
