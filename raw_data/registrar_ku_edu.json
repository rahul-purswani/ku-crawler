    "text": "Catalog Year About Catalog Year A catalog year defines which degree requirements a student will follow, which spans over a cycle beginning in fall, continues to spring, and completes at the end of the summer term. Once a student is admitted to the university, their catalog year is established within that cycle. For example, if a student starts at KU in Summer 2023, their catalog year is 2022-2023. To view the degree requirements for the current catalog, view the academic catalog online. Former catalog years are available in the archived catalogs . Students are required to remain in one catalog year across all degree plans, which include majors, minors, and certificates. The catalog year also determines which general education requirements are assigned to students. Incoming Fall 2024 students will follow the 2024-2025 catalog year, which includes the KU Core 34 general education requirements. Students who follow the 2023-2024 catalog year and prior are assigned the KU Core general education requirements. How to Change a Catalog Year If a student wishes to add a major, minor, and/or certificate in a future catalog year, they must submit a request to opt forward into a newer catalog year. If approved, this will adjust the degree requirements for any major, minor, and/or certificate on their degree plan to align with the catalog year. Once a student opts forward, they are not able to reverse their decision and move back to a former catalog year. Before submitting a change of catalog year form, students must do the following: Schedule a meeting with their academic advisor(s) to discuss the impact of this change on their current degree plan. If a student is active in multiple schools, including majors and minors, they should meet with each advisor. If a student is following the 2023-2024 catalog year or prior, and wishes to move to the 2024-2025 catalog year or after, they must review the KU Core 34 general education requirements. Catalog FAQs I am a current student following a 2023-24 or prior catalog. Can I add or update my major and/or minor to one that is offered for the first time in the 2024-25 catalog? Click to expand If you want to add a major and/or minor that's offered in a newer catalog year, then all of your major and/or minor degree requirements will be moved to the new catalog year, including general education requirements. You are strongly encouraged to discuss how this change might impact your progress toward completing your degree with your academic advisor . I am a current student who has completed all KU Core courses, but now I want to declare a new major that falls in a future catalog year. Will my KU Core still be completed if I change my major? Click to expand If you are currently following the KU Core general education requirements (catalog year prior to Fall 2024) and you would like to add a major that exists for the first time in the Fall 2024 catalog, then you will need to follow the new general education model of the KU Core 34 . Any KU Core courses will be plugged into the new Core 34 requirements individually as courses apply differently under the new Core 34 model. You may be required to take additional courses to fulfill Core 34 requirements as part of your new degree requirements. It is important to discuss how this change may impact your degree and general education requirements with your academic advisor since updating the catalog year cannot be reversed. Can I update my catalog year to any catalog? Click to expand No, you can only opt forward to the most recent catalog year. In addition, there is no option to revert to a prior catalog year. You must have a clear understanding of the impacts on your current degree requirements and that changing your catalog year may delay your progress toward graduation. If I am admitted into a new professional school, does my catalog year change to my first term in the school automatically? Click to expand No, your catalog year does not change based upon your admission to a new school. Your degree requirements will be what exists in the catalog year you are following at the university. If you would like to change your catalog year, you must submit the Change of Catalog Year form that is processed by the Office of the University Registrar. What are the impacts of updating my catalog year? Click to expand If you choose to update your catalog year, this means the degree requirements for any major(s), minor(s), and/or certificate(s) on your student record must also change to the new catalog degree requirements. This may also change the general education requirements depending on which catalog year you started in at KU, and the catalog year you wish to opt in to: If you are in a catalog year year prior to Fall 2024, you are currently following the KU Core general education requirements. By opting into a catalog year of Fall 2024 or after, then your general education requirements will shift to the new KU Core 34 requirements. If you are in a catalog year beginning Fall 2024 or after, then you are following the KU Core 34 general education requirements. Since updating a catalog year will change your degree requirements and potentially your general education requirements, it may delay your progress toward graduation. Where can I find my degree requirements? Click to expand The academic catalog is the official record of degree requirements for the university. The catalog for the current academic year is available to view online . If you are searching for prior catalog years, they can be found in the catalog archives . Request a Change to Your Catalog Year You may request to opt forward to the most recent catalog year with the online Change of Catalog Year form. Change My Catalog Year Change My Catalog Year",

    "text": "Systemwide General Education About Systemwide General Education Systemwide General Education is a framework developed by the Kansas Board of Regents to provide a consistent set of hours and discipline groupings for students to take at any of the state universities in Kansas. There are seven discipline areas that students must take a specific amount of hours of coursework within, totaling 34-35 hours of credit. Once all credit has been earned within these disciplines, a notation is placed on the students transcript that they have completed the Systemwide General Education requirements. KU Core 34 At the University of Kansas, Systemwide General Education (SGE) is called the KU Core 34. The shift to utilizing the Systemwide General Education framework will begin with the incoming class of Fall 2024. The distribution of hours across discipline buckets at KU is as follows: KU Core 34 Discipline Areas Credit Hours English 6 hours Communications 3 hours Math and Statistics 3 hours Natural and Physical Sciences 4-5 hours; must include a lab Social and Behavioral Sciences 6 hours in 2 different disciplines Arts and Humanities 6 hours in 2 different disciplines US Culture - Institutionally Designated Area 3 hours Global Culture - Institutionally Designated Area 3 hours Upcoming 2024-2025 Catalog Requirements The KU Core 34 general education requirements will apply to incoming students starting in Fall 2024. Transfer Students Transfer students starting at the university in Fall 2024 through Summer 2025 may request to opt-out of the KU Core 34 requirements.

Repeated Courses Click to expand If a student takes a course at KU, receives a C+, C, C-, D+, D, D- or F in the course, enrolls in and repeats the course at KU, the new grade may be used in place of the original grade for purpose of GPA calculation, subject to the limitations found in the Grade Replacement Policy in Repeat Courses . Courses taken Prior to Fall 2001: the grades for both the original and repeated courses count toward the GPA. Release of Information Click to expand Transcripts cannot be released to a third party without the written consent of the student in accordance with the Family Educational Rights and Privacy Act of 1974, as amended. If a person has given an individual power of attorney to conduct business on his or her behalf, we can accept a written transcript request from the appointed person. A copy of the power of attorney must accompany the written request for a transcript. Power of attorney for medical purposes only will not be sufficient. Please contact the Office of the University Registrar for instructions and the appropriate order form.

Further information on transferable credits can be found on the admissions website . USMLE Click to expand Degree Requirements for School of Medicine students include a passing score on USMLE Step 1 and Step 2. Zero Earned Hours Click to expand If a student's record reflects zero earned hours it is due to one of the following situations: Course was completed for audit purposes only. The course was completed but not to be used for a degree at University of Kansas. Course was taken through University of Kansas Continuing Education and therefore does not affect the overall KU GPA (prior to Fall 2009). The course was undergraduate level taken by a graduate student. Authenticity of Paper Transcripts Click to expand The University of Kansas employs a number of safeguards to ensure the authenticity of their transcripts: The background color of the transcript face should have multiple repetitions of the words \"The University of Kansas\" in very small print. When the front side is photocopied, the word \"Copy\" should appear in very large print across the face. If liquid bleach is applied to the front side, \"VOID\" should appear in six different languages. There is a tan basket weave pattern on the reverse side along with a watermark that appears when held at an angle. Further authentication can be obtained by calling 785-864-4423. Any alteration or modification of a transcript or any copy thereof may constitute a felony and/or lead to student disciplinary sanctions. Authenticity of Electronic (pdf) Transcripts Click to expand We apply a digital signature to the PDF transcript that is automatically validated. We implement Certified Document Services from Verisign\u00ae to mark the document as authentic, proving that it was created and published by the University of Kansas. The digital signature provides a tamper-evident wrapper on the document. The blue ribbon seal must be present to both authenticate and demonstrate the integrity of the document. This is automatically verified when the recipient views the authentic document using the free Adobe\u00ae Reader. If you do not see a certified blue ribbon in Adobe\u00ae Acrobat or Adobe\u00ae Reader bearing the words \"This document was certified by the University of Kansas with a valid certificate issued by GeoTrust CA for Adobe\" this PDF should not be accepted.

    "text": "Credit/No Credit Credit/No Credit Policy Full semester courses and short courses have different academic deadlines. Always check the deadlines on the KU\u00a0Academic Calendar . What is Credit/No Credit? Credit/No Credit (CR/NC) is a policy that allows you to take at most one course per semester without receiving final grades that factor into your GPA calculations. If you are enrolled an CR/NC course: Credit (CR)\u00a0is earned if you receive a grade of A through C- for undergraduate students\u00a0and A through C for graduate students. CR fulfills non-major specific degree requirements (such as KU Core) and allows you to move forward in course sequencing. No Credit (NC) is earned\u00a0if you receive a grade D+ through F for undergraduate students or C- through F for graduate students for a course.\u00a0NC does not fulfill degree requirements. This option is usually available for a limited time at the beginning of a semester, between the 21st and 30th instructional day.\u00a0Read the full Credit/No Credit\u00a0policy . Who should I consult with before electing to take a class for CR/NC? Your academic advisor - listed in Jayhawk GPS within \"Your Success Team\" Your major, minor, or\u00a0future\u00a0major department when considering electing CR/NC for a class that will count towards degree requirements. Notice: CR/NC allowance is up to the major/minor department or professional school you plan on graduating from, not the department in which you are taking the course.\u00a0Example: Pre-Business students should consult with the School of Business before taking any degree requirements for CR/NC for MATH 115, ACCT 200, etc. Check on your current grade and points left possible in a class before electing to take it for CR/NC. It may be helpful to calculate your GPA and/or consult with the Office of\u00a0Financial Aid & Scholarships for assistance. Why might I opt-in to Credit/No Credit? Some students choose this option if they want to prevent a low grade in a class from damaging a GPA but still need to earn credit and complete the class. (CR) Credit - fulfills degree requirements,\u00a0and allows you to move forward in course sequencing. (NC) No Credit - does not fulfill degree requirements. Receiving NC for a course can often lead to a student having to repeat the course if it is still needed to graduate. What courses are eligible? This varies greatly per class. It's important to consider why you are taking a course. Is it a KU Core requirement? Generally, okay to elect these as CR/NC. Check with your advisor. Is it a class you are taking for admission into a Professional School or Graduate level program? Check with the School or program before you make the election. Is it a class that is required for your major? CR/NC may not be used for satisfaction of the requirements for an undergraduate major or toward the satisfaction of the requirements for a graduate degree or a graduate certificate, except in the School of Law. Is it a class that is needed for licensure? Check with your advisor, School, or program before you make the election. These are all questions academic units consider. CR/NC may not be used for classes for satisfaction of the requirements for an undergraduate major or toward the satisfaction of the requirements for a graduate degree or a graduate certificate, except in the School of Law. There are also courses that require a final grade due to licensure requirements. Some programs use \"default\" grades for students who take classes as CR/NC\u00a0when it comes to calculating GPA for admission purposes. College of Liberal Arts & Sciences Students: The course you select for CR/NC cannot be used to fulfil your major or minor requirement (undergraduate students) or cannot be used to fulfill any degree or certificate requirements (graduate students). Please note that submitting a course that you need to meet your major or minor requirement would be in violation of the University and College CR/NC policy. Courses taken as CR/NC do not count toward satisfaction of the Dean's Honor Roll requirements (minimum 3.5 GPA in 12 or more graded hours). If you plan to apply to another KU school, contact that school to ask if they will accept CR/NC for the class. Pre-Law Students: The Credential Assembly Service (CAS) does its own cumulative GPA calculation and recognizes No Credit (NC) as an F.\u00a0Be mindful of this when electing CR/NC as it will not factor in your KU GPA, but it will be factored in as an F by CAS when they send grades to prospective law schools. Contact the Pre-Law advisor in Jayhawk Academic Advising for questions. Pre-graduate/Pre-professional students: Students who plan to apply to graduate or professional schools should ask them how they treat CR/NC grades. Pre-medical students: Most medical schools recommend or require that core entry requirements, usually including biology, English, chemistry, organic chemistry, physics, and mathematics, be taken for letter grades, not CR/NC How do I opt-in?

Loan Deferments - National Student Clearinghouse Click to expand The University of Kansas participates in the National Student Clearinghouse (NSC) located in Herndon, VA. Four times a semester (after the second day of classes, at approximately 20th day, mid semester, and after finals) KU submits a secure FTP (File Transfer Protocol) of students' enrollment status to the NSC who then supplies verification to lending agencies. All loan deferment forms are now forwarded to the NSC. The University does not supply information directly to lending agencies. This process speeds the flow of information to lenders and provides them with an available record of all enrollment status including enrollment at other, participating, institutions. The University of Kansas joined this service to enhance speed and accuracy. Deferments for current enrollment will not be sent until after the first day of the semester. If you need to notify the lender of a previous semester's enrollment, please indicate this on the deferment request. You must be enrolled at least half time, or be enrolled in at least 3 hours with a GTA/GRA appointment, or be in a special internship program approved by the University to qualify for a deferment. If a student registers late, or receives an exception for a retroactive withdrawal, this information may not be reported until the next submission cycle. Occasionally your circumstances may necessitate that a manual deferment form be submitted to your lender. If that is the case, please complete the loan deferment form . Be sure to be in contact with your lender to see if they are a Clearinghouse participant prior to submitting the form to our office. Submission of a deferment form in conjunction of the report from the Clearinghouse may cause problems particularly if there is a discrepancy in the two due to a change in enrollment between the date of the form and the date of the submission. If you have a unique situation, please contact emprocessing@ku.edu to explain your needs. If you are eligible for deferment, but received a collection letter you should: Contact your lender or loan servicer to verify your deferment status. Sometimes deferment forms are received between the time the NSC supplies the information, and the lending agency sends out collection letters. If your lender or servicer is unable to verify your deferment, contact the National Student Clearinghouse at: Phone: 703-742-4200 Customer Service hours:\u202fMon.-Thu., 9 am-7 pm and Fri., 9 am-5 pm EST) E-mail: service@studentclearinghouse.org Mail: National Student Clearinghouse, 13454 Sunrise Valley Dr., Suite 300, Herndon, VA 20171 If an emergency exists, (i.e. you are being threatened with default) the Clearinghouse will contact the lender with the appropriate information and ensure the proper form is processed on a high priority basis.

Please keep in mind, short courses have different deadlines. Short course deadlines are found here . You may elect the CR/NC option for at most one course per semester. No course graded CR or NC can count toward the satisfaction of the requirements for an undergraduate major or toward the satisfaction of the requirements for a graduate degree or a graduate certificate, except in the School of Law. Instructors are not notified of your choice to elect credit/no-credit for their course CR and NC are recorded as follows: Undergraduates: CR is recorded for grades of C- and above; NC is recorded for grades of D+ and below. Graduates: CR is recorded for grades of C and above; NC is recorded for grades of C- and below.

It was redesigned in 1964 by Elden Tefft, professor emeritus of art, for the university\u2019s centennial. What the seal means The seal pictures Moses kneeling in awe before a bush engulfed in flames. The translation of the Latin inscription on the seal is \u201cI will see this great vision in which the bush does not burn.\u201d The story of Moses\u2019 vision is from the third chapter of Exodus in the Bible. Fire symbolizes knowledge in many stories and myths. Moses is thought to represent the humble attitude of the scholar who recognizes the unquenchable nature of the pursuit of truth and knowledge. Use of the seal The seal may be used only on materials of an official or ceremonial nature, including diplomas and documents related to Commencement. The seal may not be used as a logo or identity, a design element in recruitment materials, or a decorative element on invitations, note cards, or similar materials.

    "text": "Personal Information and Privacy The University of Kansas ensures the confidentiality of student records in accordance with various federal, state, and university regulations, including the Family Educational Rights and Privacy Act (FERPA), as amended, also known as the Buckley Amendment. Disclosure of information is governed by the Student Records Policy as administered by the Office of the University Registrar and General Counsel. A student can elect to place an information hold to prevent the university from releasing directory information. To release an information hold complete the Request to Remove Information Hold Form . Under FERPA, a student has the right to: inspect and review their educational records; request to amend their educational records; have some control over the disclosure of information from their educational records. Education Records Click to expand Records that are directly related to a student and that are maintained by the University or by a party acting for the University. A record means any information recorded in any way, including, but not limited to, handwriting, print, tape, film, microfilm, microfiche, computerized and/or digitized storage. Records described in items 1-5 below are excluded from the category of ''education records,'' therefore, the law does not guarantee the right of student access to the following: Records created by and kept in the sole possession of an individual staff member that are not revealed to any other individual except to a person who might temporarily substitute for the original staff member. Medical and psychological records that are maintained only in connection with provision of treatment to the student and that are not available to persons other than those providing treatment except that such records may be personally reviewed by a physician or other appropriate professional of the student's choice and with the student's written consent. Records that contain only information relating to a person after that person is no longer a student at the University. An example would be information collected by the University or the Alumni Association pertaining to the accomplishments of an alumnus/alumna. Employment records of any person if maintained in the normal course of business and used only for purposes relating to the employment, unless the person is employed at the University only because of status as a student. In such cases, student employment records are education records and are\u202fcovered by this policy. Records of the KU Public Safety Office created and maintained by that department for the purpose of law enforcement. Records that are grades on peer-graded papers, before they are collected and recorded by a teacher. Directory Information Click to expand The student related directory information is defined by the University of Kansas as: name month and day of birth current address and telephone number permanent address and telephone number e-mail address (In order to protect individual privacy, a student\u2019s email address is not considered \u201cdirectory information\u201d where requests by non-university organizations for multiple e-mail addresses are made.) level and school major field of study enrollment status (full-time; half-time; less than half-time) dates of attendance degrees, honors, and awards received the most recent previous educational institution attended by the student participation in officially recognized activities and sports (including participation status); and height and weight of members of athletic teams For purposes of official University news releases, or conducting University business and advancement, student photographs and parent name, address, telephone number and e-mail are also defined as directory information. The name(s), position(s), length of service and/or courses taught may be disclosed for student employees. Restricting Access to Directory Information Click to expand Under FERPA and the Student Records Policy the university may release directory information without a student's prior consent, unless the student tells the university not to release this information, by placing an information hold . Four important details regarding placing an information hold on a student's record: Once an information hold has been applied to the record, the student whose record the hold has been applied to will need to provide photo identification before staff can provide any details about their record. This can be via an official KU email account or in person at the 1502 Building, 1502 Iowa St. The university receives many inquiries for directory information from a variety of sources inside and outside the institution, including friends, parents, relatives, prospective employers, the news media, honor societies, and other members of the public. An information hold will preclude the release of such information, even to those people. An information hold applies to all elements of directory information in a student's student record. Information holds can only be applied to currently enrolled student's accounts. Any information released prior to the placement of the hold cannot be changed. To release the restriction placed on your directory information complete the Request to Remove Information Hold Form .

The KU official will make arrangements for access and notify the student of the time and place where the records may be inspected. If the records are not maintained by the KU official to whom the request was submitted, that official shall advise the student of the correct official to whom the request should be addressed. (2) The right to request amendments of the student's education records that the student believes is inaccurate. Students may ask KU to amend a record that they believe is inaccurate. They should write the KU official responsible for the record (see KU Student Records Policy ) clearly identify the part of the record they want changed, and specify why it is inaccurate. If KU decides not to amend the record as requested by the student, KU will notify the student of the decision and advise the student of his or her right to a hearing regarding the request for amendment.

Transfer Credit FAQs transfercredit@ku.edu Additional Considerations for Transfer Credit Minimum Grade for Transfer Credit Click to expand Transfer credit with grades of D+ and below (or the equivalent grade) are not applied towards degree requirements. If the course is otherwise transferable, grades of D+, D, D-, and F (or the equivalent grades) are used to calculate the cumulative KU Transfer GPA for admission and scholarship purposes. Please see KU's Transfer Courses minimum GPA and GPA Calculation policy and the Determining GPA section below for more information. Determining Transfer GPA Click to expand Upon submitting a transfer application, a KU Transfer GPA is created for admission eligibility and scholarships. The KU Transfer GPA is a cumulative calculation of all accepted transfer coursework with an A-F grade. Grades from transfer courses are considered in making decisions for admission to the university, entry into specific programs, and for satisfying degree requirements. Transfer students are assured admission with 24+ transferable credit hours at a GPA of 2.5 or higher from a regionally accredited community college, college, or university. Please note that grades from transfer courses are not used in the calculation of the KU Overall GPA (which is just KU coursework). Lower-Level and Upper-Level (JR/SR) Credit Click to expand Courses are matched as closely as possible by topic, but different colleges and universities may designate different levels of credit for the same course. The originating institution defines the level of credit for a course. A lower-level course completed at your original institution may match an upper-level course (numbers 300 and above) once transferred to KU, but would still retain lower-level credit on your record, and vice versa. All community college courses transfer as lower-level credit. Please see KU's policy on Course Level Transfer for additional details. Credit Hour Limits Click to expand KU does not restrict the number of transfer courses that are accepted. However, the number of credits that are applicable toward degree requirements is limited based on the source of the transfer credits. A maximum of 75 credits from 2-year institutions can be applied to degree requirements at KU. There is no limit of credit that can be applied to degree requirements from a 4-year institution. Students are required to complete at least 45 upper-level credits with 30 upper-level credits in residence to earn a degree. Credit Conversion Click to expand KU's unit of credit is the semester hour. Credit earned at institutions using a different unit of credit are converted upon being transferred to KU. For quarter hour schools, KU awards the standard .67 semester credits per quarter credit hour of study. Please see the conversion chart below. Quarter Semester .5 .33 1 .67 2.0 1.33 3.0 2.0 4 2.67 5 3.33 6 4.0 Graduate Coursework Click to expand At the discretion of the major department and the Graduate Division, any graduate student may transfer up to nine (9) hours of graduate credit taken at a regionally-accredited graduate school and apply it to a KU master\u2019s degree plan, as long as the credits were taken prior to the final semester of enrollment at KU. Please see the Graduate Studies policy for more information about the requirements needed to apply graduate credit towards a KU degree. Graduate students interested in transferring credit need to start the transfer credit approval process with their academic department.

Click to expand All courses evaluated by KU for transfer are searchable on the KU CredTran website . If a course cannot be found on\u00a0CredTran, it has not been evaluated for transfer. Please reach out to transfercredit@ku.edu to request an evaluation. A complete syllabus may be needed. What courses will be accepted as transfer credit by KU? Click to expand College-level courses completed at an institution accredited by one of the below bodies will transfer, provided the course is similar in level, scope and content to courses offered at KU and a grade of C- or higher is earned. Accrediting Commissions for Community and Junior Colleges (ACCJC) Western Association of Schools and Colleges Higher Learning Commission (HLC) Middle States Commission on Higher Education (MSCHE) New England Commission on Higher Education (NECHE) Northwest Commission on Colleges and Universities (NWCC) Southern Association of Colleges and Schools Commission on Colleges (SACSCOC) WASC Senior College and University Commission (WSCUC) Why didn't I get credit for all my previous coursework? Click to expand Transfer courses may not be awarded credit at KU for several reasons. These courses are typically pre-collegiate, remedial, vocational, internship, graduate, professional (e.g. law, medicine, dentistry, nursing), technical or religious in nature and do not fall within the\u00a0level, scope, content\u00a0and expected learning outcomes of courses offered at KU. Credit can only be posted to the KU record from official transcripts sent directly from the institution at which the credit was completed or official score reports sent directly from the testing board, even if they are posted on a transcript from another institution. How can I appeal a transfer credit evaluation? Click to expand The Office of the University Registrar provides transfer credit evaluations based on official transcripts from regionally accredited US institutions. Students may request a re-evaluation of their course work if they believe the initial evaluation and transfer credit equivalency does not accurately reflect the scope of the original course. Fill out the Request for Re-Evaluation of Transfer Credit form and attach a course syllabus. A complete syllabus includes a course description, text book information, grading scale, learning outcomes, and a weekly breakdown of the content covered in the course. How many credits will KU allow me to transfer? Click to expand KU does not restrict the number of transfer courses that are accepted. However, the number of credits that are applicable toward degree requirements is limited based on the source of the transfer credits. For students matriculating to KU in Fall 2024 (or after): A maximum of 75 credits from 2-year institutions can be applied to degree requirements at KU. There is no limit of credit that can be applied to degree requirements from a 4-year institution. Students are required to complete at least 45 upper-division credits with 30 upper-division credits needing to be completed at KU to earn a degree. My course is equivalent to a 300-level course, why did I not earn JR/SR hours? Click to expand The originating institution defines the level of credit. A lower-level course completed at your original institution may match an upper-level course at KU (numbers 300 and above), but it would still retain lower-level credit, and vice versa. All community college courses transfer as lower-level credit. Please see policy on Course Level Transfer for additional details. Courses are matched as closely as possible by topic, but different schools may designate different levels of credit for the same course. How do courses transfer from a quarter system school? Click to expand KU awards the standard .67 semester credits per quarter credit hour of study. A 3 credit course from a quarter school will be awarded 2 credits at KU.

Click to expand Grades from transfer courses are considered in making decisions for admission to the university, entry into specific program, and for satisfying degree requirements. However, grades from transfer courses are not used in the calculation of the KU Overall GPA. Transfer courses KU accepted will not appear on the KU official transcript. Grades for all transfer courses will appear on the unofficial KU Advising Report. Can I get credit for courses taken as Credit/No Credit or Pass/Fail? Click to expand KU will award credit for Pass or Credit grades. Pass (P) or Credit (CR) grades typically do not satisfy major or minor requirements. Can I take a course at an external institution to replace a grade I received in a KU course? Click to expand No. The grade replacement policy only applies when a course is taken at KU and the same course is repeated at KU. The grade at the external institution will not replace the grade received at KU, which will still factor into the KU GPA. See 2.3.9 Grade Replacement Policy in Repeated Courses for more information.

    "text": "Residency Resident tuition classification is determined by criteria found in Kansas statutes and regulations of the Kansas Board of Regents and is evaluated on four basic categories. Students are responsible for providing information sufficient to support their applications for resident classification. Students have until the 30th calendar day after the first day of classes in the term they are applying for residency to submit a residency application or waiver. A general overview of the procedures and criteria used for evaluation is below. All four categories must be demonstrated to support the claim of resident for fee purposes. Students retaining ties to other states will impede their ability to prove Kansas Residency for tuition classification purposes. Continuous physical residency in Kansas for at least 365 days prior to the first day of classes for which a student is applying for residency. Sources of financial support to meet living expenses of the student must come from Kansas sources. Sources of income that are from full-time, non-student, jobs are more beneficial. Living expenses include, but are not limited to: Tuition, fees and books Housing and associated costs Food Insurance Transportation Phone Intent to remain in Kansas indefinitely. Intent is exhibited by actions taken, not by a statement of intent. Factors shall be considered in support of claim if they have existed for at least one year before enrollment or re-enrollment. Factors may include, but are not limited to: Kansas driver's license Kansas voter registration Kansas vehicle registration Kansas home ownership Student is residing in Kansas for reasons other than educational purposes. If the student enrolls full-time at a Kansas institution of higher education upon moving to Kansas this requirement is the hardest to overcome because the presumption is the student is here for educational purposes. Information on the University of Kansas website does not replace or supercede the statutes or Kansas Board of Regents\u2019 regulations. International Students: International students who are not citizens of the United States must meet the same criteria as a citizen in order to gain resident classification. However, intent to remain indefinitely in the state of Kansas, and the United States, generally cannot be demonstrated unless the student possesses Permanent Resident Alien status and has been in that status for twelve months prior to the first day of classes. Marriage to a U.S. citizen does not change the criteria an individual must meet. Other Residency Situations and Waivers: Students who meet certain categories of criteria are eligible for tuition assessments equal to resident rates when authorized by the Kansas legislature and the Kansas Board of Regents. These privileges do not change a non-resident classification.

Your instructor will provide additional information. Conflicting Examinations Click to expand In case a student is subjected to conflicting examinations as listed in the final examination schedule for the appropriate semester, the last mentioned arranges an examination for the affected student at a different time. When the conflicting examinations are between French and Italian and Spanish, an examination for the affected student is arranged at a different time by French and Italian for spring semesters and by Spanish for fall semesters. If one of the conflicting examination times is a Common Examination (e.g., all sections of Accounting 321), the non-Common Examination instructor will arrange an alternate time. In the case of students with final examinations on multiple campuses for the same day, the same procedures apply for determining if a conflict exists and how it should be resolved. In addition to the standard time of the exam, sixty minutes of time should be added to the beginning and end time of the examinations to accommodate travel time between locations when determining if a conflict exists. If one of the conflicting examination times is in an Online Course Examination, the Online Examination instructor will arrange an alternate time. Classes starting at times not listed on the Final Examination Chart Click to expand The final examination will be administered at the scheduled time for classes that meet during the next-closest time\u00a0(next time going forward)\u00a0in the Monday-Wednesday-Friday or Tuesday-Thursday sequence. For example a class that meets at 9:30 a.m. on Monday, Wednesday and Friday would have its final examination at the time scheduled for 10:00 a.m. Monday-Wednesday-Friday classes. Classes that meet daily will follow the Monday-Wednesday-Friday schedule for finals. Classes that meet once a week will follow the schedule that includes the day of the week that a particular class meets. For example, a Monday or a Wednesday class would follow the Monday-Wednesday-Friday schedule. Night Classes Click to expand Final examinations for classes that begin at 5 p.m. or later will have examinations from 7:30 - 10 p.m. during the final examination period on the same night of the week that the class regularly met. If the class meets twice a week or more, a final will be on the first evening during the finals period that corresponds with a night that the class meets. For example a Tuesday-Thursday evening class would hold its examination on Tuesday. Three or More Finals Click to expand Except for those excused in advance by the instructor, all students are required to take final examinations when prescribed.\u00a0However, in the event that a student has (3) three or more final examinations scheduled on the same day, no student shall be obligated to take more than two exams on that day.\u00a0No later than two weeks before Stop Day, the student shall notify the instructor(s) from the highest numbered course(s) not having a common final exam of the need to provide a make-up examination to be administered at a mutually acceptable time. A Common Final Exam is defined as one approved for a particular multi-section course by the Calendar Committee in accordance with USRR 1.3.1, and published in the Timetable. Lecture classes with various discussion or laboratory sections are not \"Common Finals\" for the purpose of this regulation. The School of Law and School of Pharmacy follow a different final examination schedule Click to expand Students who are enrolled in the School of Law or the School of Pharmacy should consult the unit to determine the times of their final examinations.",

    "text": "Special Exam Policies Definition: A Special Exam is an examination for a course that is administered at a time other than the regularly scheduled class hours. These are often put in place to provide a common examination for a multiple section course or to provide an examination time that has a longer duration. Publication: Starting for Fall 2014, Special Exams are published in the Schedule of Classes . They can be viewed as part of the class in Enroll & Pay or in the Schedule of Classes . Resolutions of Conflicts: If a special examination(s) conflicts with a student\u2019s obligation to other regularly scheduled classes, the student shall be accorded the opportunity to take the examination or test at a time NOT in conflict with other regularly scheduled university classes. In case a student is subjected to conflicting special examinations the highest numbered course in alphabetical order would arrange an examination at a different time for the affected student. If the conflict is within the same department, then the higher numbered course would make the arrangements. Example: BIOL 100 is in conflict with PHSX 200. PHSX 200 would make the accommodation. PHSX 200 is in conflict with PHSX 500. PHSX 500 would make the accommodation.

    "text": "CourseLeaf FAQ What is Courseleaf? Powerful tool that intergrates Peoplesoft course catalog maintenance (CAT). CourseLeaf curriculum automates how courses and programs are proposed, approved and entered into PeopleSoft and the Academic Catalog (CIM). What are the CourseLeaf modules? The CourseLeaf System has two distinct modules: CAT is the Academic Catalog , the public facing module. CIM is the course and program management module with a workflow component. In CIM you can edit existing courses and programs or propose new courses and programs. CIM-Course Inventory Management CIM-Program Management Short, usage specific videos have also been developed to help users navigate the CIM system. Propose a New Program Propose a New Course Edit a New Course Approve a Course Retire a Course Edit a Program Course Component Definitions How do I log out of CourseLeaf? Close your browser. CAT Questions Is there a User guide that explains the CAT editing choices and how to use them? Click to expand CourseLeaf offers a User guide available at their support site. To access the CourseLeaf website, open the working catalog . Open the Toolbar and select the Help button. When the CourseLeaf website opens, there will be a link to Print End-Users Guide PDF. You can print the PDF or you can open the PDF and search for the help you need. Information on Browsers is on page 4 Website Accessibility is on page 5 Information on Showing Differences (Red/Green Markup) is on page 5 Information on creating/editing an online course is on page 9 Information on creating/editing tables is on pages 18-30 Information on the Toolbar is on pages 30-36 How do Page Owners start CAT workflow on a page? Click to expand Navigate to the catalog page and select the page you would like to edit. Select \u201cEdit\u201d in the top right and start editing the page. Select the green start workflow button and the page will move to the first step of workflow. If you are ready to release a page and the start workflow button is grayed out, select Edit Page Body on the left to open the edit window, and if no changes are needed, select the OK button and this will activate the start workflow button from gray to green. You can then select it to begin workflow. How do I create a link to an external url or to an email address? Click to expand Links are added to a page through the Insert/Edit Link button in the Page Body Editor. To add a link, highlight the words in the Page Body Editor that you would like to show as a link. Then select the Insert/Edit Link button and enter the URL of the page to link to in the URL text box. If you are linking to a page outside the catalog, include the entire URL starting with http:// . To link to an email address, in the URL enter mailto: and the email address to send to. When this link is selected the users default email program will open a new email window. Why are there red boxes around courses? Click to expand A red box indicates that the information in the red box is not found in the course data extracted from Peoplesoft. This may indicate that you have entered in the course code incorrectly. It may also indicate that Peoplesoft has not been extracted recently to show new course information. If you have red boxes around a number of courses, this could indicate that there is something that needs attention with the Peoplesoft or CourseLeaf system. If you believe that the course information in the red box is correct, please contact your CourseLeaf Administrator. It is important to fix all red boxes before publishing. Why is there a red box around course hours? Click to expand If there is a red box around course hours, it indicates that the hours listed do not match what is in the course database. When you hover over the red box, a pop-up will display how many hours the source has it listed for. If you are certain that the course needs x amount of hours, then simply leave it. This is only a warning. The catalog can still be published with red boxes around the hours and the red boxes will not appear in the published catalog. Plan of Study Grid - When Fall and Spring are flipped with Spring appearing first, how can you change the order? Click to expand Open the page and change the Starting Plan Grid from Spring Plan Grid to Fall Plan Grid. CIM Questions How do I cross-list a new course(s) with an existing course? Click to expand To cross-list a new course(s) with an existing course, you can edit the existing course and add the new course(s) in the Cross Listed Courses area by selecting the green plus button and entering the Subject and Course Number in the Quick Add/Add Course function. The title will appear as \"Course Not Found\" until you submit the proposal to workflow. Once submitted to workflow the title will match the parent course. How do I cross-list two or more new courses? Click to expand To cross-list two or more new courses, select one course to be the \u201cparent\u201d and complete the Propose New Course form adding the other course(s) in the Cross Listed Courses area by selecting the green plus button and entering the Subject and Course Number in the Quick Add/Add Course function. The title will appear as \"Course Not Found\" until you submit the proposal to workflow. Once submitted to workflow the title will match the parent course. How do I cross-list two existing courses? Click to expand It is not possible to cross-list two existing courses because the CourseLeaf system recognizes both of the courses as parent courses. You can choose one of the existing courses to be the parent course and follow the instructions for cross-listing a new course with an existing course.

Click to expand Existing course numbers can be changed when they fall in the following ranges. Moving a course to a different number range requires inactivating the existing course and creating a new course proposal with the new course number. (You can copy the existing course making any needed changes). 100-299 300-499 500-699 700-999 How do I copy a course into a New Course Proposal? Click to expand Select the green Propose New Course button. Once the form opens and loads, select the green Copy Course button in the upper right-hand corner of the form. This will open the course picker. Use the course picker to select the current course which matches most closely the course to be proposed, then edit the relevant fields. The course number will not pre-populate. Why is my course not found? Click to expand Courses are \"not found\" when they do not exist in the PeopleSoft data extract. There could be a few reasons for this: The subject code and course number you're using may be incorrect. ENG vs ENGL for English The last extract from Peoplesoft might have been run before\u00a0new course data was entered into PeopleSoft.\u00a0 During the catalog cycle we run a weekly course import usually on Mondays. What happens if a course or program proposal is shredded? Click to expand Admins may shred course or program proposals with the Shred button, once a course or program has been edited. Shredding the proposal removes all edits from this proposal and sets the course or program back to the last approved state. It also removes the proposal from workflow. The course or program is now at rest and may be edited again. For new proposals, shredding the proposal removes it completely from the system, since there is no previously approved state. How do I delete a CIM proposal that was started by mistake? Click to expand Admins may use the Shred button to shred a proposal and set the course or program back to the last approved state. If it was a new proposal, the proposal is deleted from the system. What is \"Preview Workflow?\" Click to expand Preview Workflow allows you to see what the workflow approval path would look like if the proposal were to be submitted at that moment.\u00a0 The workflow may change depending on the values entered in the form. For example, if you propose a course as KU Core, the University Core Curriculum Committee will be included in workflow. Every time you change a proposal, the Preview Workflow may change. What is the difference between the different \"Save\" options? Click to expand When creating or editing a proposal in CIM, there are three options at the bottom of the proposal: Cancel (red) Cancel (red) - Close the proposal and discard any changes since the last save Save (white) Save the proposal.\u00a0 This does not require all fields to be filled in and will allow you to resume the proposal at a later time. Save and Submit (or Start Workflow) (green) Save the proposal and submit it for approval. All required fields will be enforced at this time. How can I tell where my proposal is in workflow? Click to expand Workflow steps are tracked on the right-hand side of the proposal in a vertical list. Completed Workflow steps are green, the current Workflow step is orange, and future Workflow steps are gray. Directly under this list is the Approval Path. The Approval Path list provides Date/Time/User stamps for each of the completed Workflow steps. Does CourseLeaf provide an audit of changes made to a course or program? Click to expand Yes, when you are reviewing a course or program, there is a History list for all courses and programs that have been updated since we implemented CourseLeaf. The History list appears on the right-hand side of the page and will provide a Date/Time/User stamp for each submission. Select the User name to open the page and you can see the red/green markup of what was submitted. You can also see any Course Reviewer Comments.",

Any student who is considering requesting a change to credit/no credit (CR/NC) is strongly encouraged to receive approval by an academic advisor, who will record notes in Jayhawk GPS, or associate dean before making this change. Further, it is important to note that, if the CR/NC is not currently permitted by a school or program for a licensure course, it will not be permitted as part of this policy.\u202fStudents should consult with the Office of Financial Aid and Scholarships and their advisor before changing grading options for their course(s). 2.2.8.1 For spring and summer 2021 terms, courses that currently use letter grades will continue to use letter grades. However, students may individually request to receive or rescind a request for grades of credit/no credit through the form below. All requests for credit/no credit grading option, or to rescind the credit/no credit grading option must be submitted using the below forms no later than 11:59 p.m., December 3, 2021*. Students may select to change one or all of their classes in which they are enrolled (if changing more than one course the form will need to be submitted for each course individually). 2.2.8.6 Undergraduate students: Courses taken during the spring and summer 2021 semester for credit/no credit, that are satisfactorily completed, can count toward a student\u2019s undergraduate major requirements. Courses graded credit/no credit do not count in computing grade point average. When a student changes academic programs, any satisfactorily completed credits accumulated during spring 2021 will be accepted by the new KU department. Graduate students: Courses graded credit/no credit may be taken in a graduate program if the course is not needed to fulfill hours toward the satisfaction of requirements. No course graded credit/no credit can count toward the satisfaction of the requirements for a graduate degree or a graduate certificate. 2.2.8.7 Students will choose to receive either the letter grade recorded by the instructor OR a credit /no credit designation by the deadline, December 3, 2021. Faculty will grade students as usual during the semester, and submit the letter grade (A-F, I) to the University Registrar following the standard submission process.

Reverse Transfer allows you to receive your associate degree from the Kansas community college or technical college you have earned the most credits from by combining the credits you earned there and the credits you earn after transferring to a Kansas public university. Within your first year, if you transfer coursework from a community college or technical college to a public university, you will be notified you are eligible to be considered for Reverse Transfer.\u00a0 You are eligible if you have completed 45 credit hours at or or more colleges and if you consent to the release of your academic records.\u00a0 If you consent (also known as \"opting in\") your academic records will be evaluated for degree completion and your degree will be conferred based upon a satisfactory evaluation.\u00a0 Opting in is the first step, contact the registrar@ku.edu.

    "text": "Residency FAQ's FAQ's Who sets policies regarding residency? Click to expand The laws and regulations regarding residency for tuition and fee purposes are established by the Kansas Legislature and the Kansas Board of Regents . State universities are required to follow these rules and may not establish their own. The Legislature\u2019s and the Board\u2019s rules are unique to residency for tuition and fee purposes at the state universities, and residency for other purposes, such as for community college tuition, may differ. What is the basic rule regarding residency for tuition and fee purposes at state universities? Click to expand Generally, if you (or your parents, if you are a minor) have lived in Kansas more than one year (12 months), you have not been enrolled at a state university during that time, and you intend to stay in Kansas indefinitely, you will be considered a resident for tuition and fee purposes. In other words, you demonstrate that you have chosen to live in Kansas for at least 12 months because you want to make Kansas your permanent home and not just because you want to get in-state tuition. Please see K.S.A. 76-729 and K.A.R. 88-3-2 . What if my parents do not live in Kansas and still partially support me? Click to expand If your out-of-state parents have provided any financial support during the previous 365 days, and this has helped you stay in school, you are considered out-of-state because you have been dependent upon them to remain in school. If, during the previous twelve months, you have received money from other out-of-state sources (trust funds, bank loans, non-resident scholarships, etc.) in all likelihood you will be considered out-of-state. You must be able to prove that you have supported yourself for at least twelve months, paying your own tuition, fees and expenses if enrolled in school during this period. If you go home for the summer, work there, or live at home, you will be considered out-of-state. Some non-earned financial aid is acceptable if it does not tie you to any other state. I am under 18 and my parents live in another state. What if I have a guardian who lives in Kansas? Click to expand Only if parents are deceased, divorced, or legally separated is the appointment of a guardian or a grant of custody recognized for residency tuition classification. Court appointment or grant of custody is required. In most cases, guardianships terminate at age 18. Guardianships established for the sole or main purpose of qualifying the ward for resident fees will not be honored. What if I used to be a resident, left the state and have returned? Click to expand If you can prove you were a resident for tuition and fee purposes within the last five years (60 months) and that you have returned to live in Kansas please email: rtfregistrar@ku.edu for assistance. I have a Kansas driver's license and vote here. Doesn't that mean that I pay resident fees? Click to expand This is not sufficient to establish in-state tuition classification. Other agencies may consider you to be a resident for a specific purpose (taxes, voting, etc), in accordance with the statutes governing that purpose; however, for tuition payment purposes you must satisfy the appropriate Board of Regents articles. Obtaining licenses and voting are evidence that you have done some things toward eventually obtaining residence, but they will not, in and of themselves, grant you resident fee status. Conversely, having these things in another state may result in denial of in-state status. Can a Military affiliated student receive in-state tuition? Click to expand In some cases, yes. Resident tuition rates are available to veterans (and/or their spouses and dependents) who are eligible for federal education benefits, as well as all current members of the armed forces (including army, navy, marine corps, air force, coast guard, Kansas army or air national guard, or any branch of the military reserves of the United States), along with spouses and dependent children. Eligibility for resident tuition also extends to those who had established residency in Kansas while permanently stationed in Kansas or prior to service in the armed forces. In these cases, the veteran, veteran\u2019s spouse or dependent, must live in Kansas at the time of enrollment. The Armed Forces Residency Benefit page provides additional information about applying for residency at the University of Kansas in accordance with the Kansas Board of Regents Regulations. Can an international student be eligible for resident rates? Click to expand Usually, no. Students who are here on a temporary visa must leave the country once the purpose for the visa has been met. This includes all student, training, work, and practical experience visas. The evidence of a temporary visa shows the student does not have permission to reside in the state of Kansas indefinitely, therefore the person cannot demonstrate they have intent to make Kansas their permanent residence. Please see K.A.R. 88-3-2 . What about University of Kansas staff member's dependents? Click to expand The dependent spouse and children of any employee of an institution governed by the state board of regents, whether the employee\u2019s position is classified or unclassified, shall be accorded the resident fee privilege, provided that the employee holds a regular payroll for 1.0 time. The dependent spouse and children of any employee of an institution governed by the state board of regents, whether the employee\u2019s position is classified or unclassified, shall be accorded the resident fee privilege, provided that the employee holds a regular payroll appointment for at least .4 time but less than 1.0 time and is enrolled in a graduate program on the effective date of this regulation, until one of the following criteria is met: the expiration of the time allowed in the relevant university catalog for the employee to complete the aforesaid graduate program; a break in enrollment by the employee; the employee\u2019s being awarded the graduate degree from the aforesaid graduate program; or the end of the employee\u2019s employment. The provisions of this regulation shall not apply to seasonal, temporary or hourly employees. The dependent spouse and children of any employee of an affiliated corporation are not eligible for the staff rates waiver. Please see K.A.R. 88-3-9 for complete regulations. Complete the staff-dependent tuition rates application to apply for reduced tuition rates. My parents don't live in Kansas but they are taxpayers because their business is in Kansas, or they own property here. Doesn't that make me eligible for the resident fee rate? Click to expand No. By statute, residence is based upon where one physically resides and criteria associated with that residence. No provision is made for where one is employed or owns property. How do I apply for resident fee status at the University of Kansas? Click to expand After reading the regulations the complete the appropriate application form, submitting all required documentation, to the Office of the University Registrar. It will be reviewed and you will be notified of the decision by email. The deadline for submitting petitions is 30 days after the first day of classes for the term. An application can be submitted as early as 75 days in advance of the first day of classes for the upcoming term.",

Click to expand While you can't apply for the for the Armed Forces Residency Benefit (AFRB) as a current servicemember (per Kansas law), you can look at the veterans/spouses/dependents criteria, if applicable. For example, if you are using Ch. 1606 Montgomery GI Bill-Selected Reserve or another VA education benefit and will live in Kansas while attending KU, you can apply for AFRB under the veterans/spouses/dependents section. I plan to live in Missouri during college - can I get in-state tuition rates? Click to expand It depends. Current service members/spouses/dependents who apply for the Armed Forces Residency Benefit (AFRB): where you live does not matter. Veterans/spouses/dependents: if you have the Post-9/11 GI Bill at the 100% rate you may be eligible to apply for Yellow Ribbon while using the GI Bill. Otherwise, it is a requirement for students to live in Kansas while attending KU to receive AFRB. What if I am an online student in a flat-rate tuition program? Click to expand You do not need to apply for AFRB since your program is a flat rate regardless of residency status. You only need to apply if you see \u201cout-of-state\u201d indicated on your tuition charges on your KU bill. Contact us if you\u2019d like to confirm that you\u2019re in a flat-rate program. Does KU offer Yellow Ribbon? Click to expand Yes - Yellow Ribbon covers the difference between out-of-state and in-state tuition so is only for students who do not meet the Armed Forces Residency Benefit criteria who are being charged out-of-state tuition. If you plan to live in Kansas while attending KU, you will not need Yellow Ribbon - apply for in-state tuition rates per AFRB instead. You must be a Post-9/11 GI Bill user at the 100% rate to use Yellow Ribbon. If you are using Post-9/11 GI Bill at 100% and live in Missouri (or another state) while attending classes at KU, please complete the Yellow Ribbon Application each year you have benefits.

Click to expand No, you get to keep your residency status as long as you: Maintain continuous fall/spring enrollment (you can take summers off), and (For veterans/spouses/dependents) Continue to live in Kansas while attending KU (you can go home over breaks/summer) If I take a fall or a spring semester off from KU, do I need to reapply for resident status? Click to expand Yes, if you have to reapply to KU, you will have to reapply for AFRB. The one exception is if you were called to active duty, completed a military withdrawal , and returned within 3 semesters.

VA benefits may vary if you're taking short classes and/or classes with different start/end dates VA looks at your enrollment by day to determine whether you are a part-time or full-time student by their standards. This may differ from how KU classifies you. All classes must meet a graduation requirement when VA considers your full-time/part-time status. It's vital to visit with your advisor every semester. This information should only be used as a planning estimate. Individual circumstances may vary. Contact us with any questions. Ch. 30 Montgomery GI Bill - Active Duty (MGIB-AD), Ch. 1606 Montgomery GI Bill - Selected Reserve (MGIB-SR) & Ch. 35 Survivors' and Dependents' Educational Assistance (DEA) Click to expand VA pays a monthly stipend to students, not to KU. Students are responsible for their KU bill. Current rates are in the GI Bill Comparison Tool . Undergraduate Students Courses with the same start/end dates : Enrollment Status Fall & Spring Hours Summer Hours % of Benefit (approx.) Full time 12 or more 6 or more 100% 3/4 time 9-11 4-5 75% 1/2 time 6-8 3 50% <1/2 time, >1/4 time 4-5* 2* *50% 1/4 time 3 or less* 1* *25% * If your enrollment status is less than 1/2 time, VA may pay you only up to the amount charged for tuition and fees. Note for non-standard courses : For courses that don't run the full semester or have different start/end dates, VA will calculate a \"Credit Hour Equivalency\" (CHE). CHE can then be added to all other credit hours being taken to determine enrollment status. This may mean you're considered part time or full time at different points in a semester, depending on your course dates. While VA calculates official amounts, you can use this formula to estimate your CHE: 18 * number of credit hours / number of weeks the course is in session = Credit Hour Equivalency Weeks by counting the total number of days the course is in session (looking at the course's start and end dates, not just the days you have class), dividing by 7 and rounding to the nearest whole number. For partial weeks, 3 days or less are rounded down and 4 days or more are rounded up. Graduate Students Graduate students' enrollment status is based on KU's academic policy: Full-Time Enrollment for Graduate Students . For courses with the same start/end dates, enrollment status is calculated by dividing the number of credit hours you are taking by the amount of credit hours to be considered full time in a semester. This percentage is rounded down to the nearest 25% to get your enrollment status: Enrollment Status % of VA Benefit (approx.) Full time 100% 3/4 time 75% 1/2 time 50% <1/2 time, >1/4 time *50% 1/4 time *25% * If your enrollment status is less than 1/2 time, VA may pay only up to the amount charged for tuition and fees. Note for non-standard courses : For courses that do not run the full semester or have different start/end dates, VA will calculate \"Credit Hour Equivalency\" (CHE). CHE can then be added to all other credit hours being taken to determine enrollment status. This may mean you're considered part time or full time at different points in a semester, depending on your course dates.

For partial weeks, 3 days or less are rounded down and 4 days or more are rounded up. Ch. 33 Post-9/11 GI Bill Click to expand Monthly Housing Allowance (MHA) VA typically pays MHA at the beginning of the next month for the days classes were in session the previous month. To calculate your monthly MHA rate, multiply the following: Current MHA rate - Visit the GI Bill Comparison Tool . Look for the MHA based on where you are taking a majority of your classes. Edit the details in the left column. Online students should answer \"No\" to the question in the left column, \"Will you be taking any classes in person?\" to get the online student MHA. Length of service percentage - listed on your Certificate of Eligibility or on this eligibility chart . Rate of pursuit percentage, rounded\u00a0 - See tables below To get an estimate of your daily MHA rate: Divide the monthly MHA rate by 30 (for VA purposes, every month has 30 days). Note: Active duty and their spouses may not get MHA from VA. Books & Supplies Stipend VA pays you each semester up to $1,000 (24 credit hours) in an academic year (August to July). At the 100% benefit level it is $41.67 multiplied by the number of credit hours you are certified to take. If your benefit level is less than 100%, it's based on percentage (e.g. 50% benefit level = $41.67 x 50% = $20.84 per credit hour, up to 24 credits for the academic year). Rate of Pursuit (RoP) Taking a combination of short and full-semester courses or courses with different start/end dates? VA looks at your enrollment by day, which may differ from how KU looks at your enrollment. Example: if you're an undergrad in 12 credits and one of those classes is a 3-credit, 8-week course, VA will only consider you full time while that 8-week course is in session and will consider you 3/4 time (9 credits) the rest of the semester. Your MHA is adjusted accordingly. If you're in 15 credits and one of those is a 3-credit, 8-week course, you'll be considered full time the entire semester because you're still in 12 credits the whole semester. Undergraduate students Round to the nearest 10% to get your MHA rate. Enrolled in all 16-week courses with same start/end dates Enrolled in all 8-week courses with same start/end dates Enrolled in all 4-week courses Rate of Pursuit (approximate) 12 or more hours 6 or more hours 3 or more hours 100% 5 hours 93% 11 hours 92% 10 hours 83% 9 hours 4 hours 75% 8 hours 67% 7 hours 58% 3 hours 56% 6 hours 50%** 5 hours 42%** 2 hours 38%** 4 hours 33%** 3 hours 25%** **Only RoPs greater than 50% are eligible to receive MHA.

Non-standard/short courses Courses with different start/end dates outside of the traditional full-semester dates: VA calculates a \"Credit Hour Equivalency\" (CHE). The CHE for multiple courses can be added together to determine RoP (aka full-time or part-time status). This may mean VA considers you part time at different times in a semester. While VA calculates official amounts, use this formula to estimate your course's CHE: 18 * number of credit hours / number of weeks the course is in session = Credit Hour Equivalency Calculate number of weeks by counting the total number of days the course is in session (how many days from the start to the end date). Then divide by 7 and round to the nearest whole number. For partial weeks, 3 days or less are rounded down and 4 days or more are rounded up. Examples of how MHA/book stipend benefits may vary based on RoP For all examples below, assume the courses count toward graduation. Student A: Undergraduate Semester: Fall semester (e.g. Aug. 23 to Dec. 15) # of hours: 12, but one, 3-credit class does not start until Oct. 15 They can expect VA to pay the following: In-state tuition/fees made in 2 payments \u2013 one for 9 credit hours and one for 3 credit hours Housing allowance (MHA): 80% of MHA per month from Aug. 23 to Oct. 14 (75% is the rate of pursuit based on the chart above, but it gets rounded to 80% for MHA). Full MHA from Oct. 15 to end of semester 2 books and supplies stipend payments - one for $375 (for 9 credits) and a second payment of $125 closer to Oct. 15 ($41.67 per credit hour) Student B: Undergraduate Semester: Spring semester # of hours enrolled: 6 credits from Jan. 18 to May 15 They can expect $0 MHA per month because their rate of pursuit is less than 51%. Student C Undergraduate Semester: Summer semester # of hours enrolled: 3 credits from June 5-29 and 3 credits from June 5 to July 28 They can expect to receive the following: Full MHA from June 5 to June 29, because the rate of pursuit (RoP) is greater than 100% 60% of MHA from June 30 to July 28, because the RoP is 56% Guest students Seeking a degree at another school but taking a class at KU?

Chapter 31 (VR&E): check with your VR&E counselor. Chapter 33: check your Post-9/11 GI Bill Statement of Benefits on the VA's website. All other chapters: Use the Ask VA tool or call the GI Bill hotline at 888-442-4551 from 7 a.m. to 7 p.m. CDT. Will my VA benefits cover a Minor and/or a second Major and/or a Certificate Program? Click to expand Minors/Majors : Yes, the GI Bill will cover additional majors and minors. Effective Fall 2024, we received updated information from our Education Liaison Representative that VA doesn't limit the number of majors/minors a student can have. Certificate program: Undergraduate certificate programs are not approved for the GI Bill, unfortunately. Certificate program courses must meet some other KU graduation requirement in order for the VA to approve the courses. Graduate certificate program: If your program is listed in WEAMS , VA will cover it. If it is not in WEAMS, contact us . Will the GI Bill pay for (or provide me my full monthly stipend if I'm not using the Post-9/11 GI Bill) for every class that I want to take? Click to expand Only classes that meet a graduation requirement for your degree program, minor, dual degree, or dual major, can be reported to the VA for the purpose of determining your rate of pursuit (full-time status). Speak with your advisor to make sure your course fits some sort of graduation requirement (e.g. in your major, KU Core goals, junior/senior hours, etc.). The VA will not pay for repeat courses unless you received an \u201cF\u201d OR must pass with a certain grade in order to move forward in your program. When will I receive my monthly stipend from the VA? Click to expand Part of it depends on when you submit your KU request for benefits. On average, it takes KU 10-14 business days to send your info to VA (peak times, i.e. August & January, may take longer). VA has 30 days from that point to process your paperwork and will notify you once it's complete. You should then receive your monthly stipend at the beginning of the next month for the time you were in classes the previous month(s). VA typically pays around the first of every month for the previous month. For example, around Sept. 1 (though it could be a few days later) you\u2019ll get a payment for the days you were in classes in August. For VA purposes, each month has 30 days so you can calculate prorated amounts by dividing your monthly stipend by 30 and multiplying by number of days school is in session (e.g. if classes being Aug. 20 and BAH is $1494, your BAH for August would be $498). Visit the GI Bill Comparison Too l to see your specific rates. Classes have started and I have not received my VA benefits, will KU charge me a late fee or cancel my enrollment? Click to expand When you complete your Using VA Benefits web form for the semester, we push your deadline back to Dec. 15 (fall), May 15 (spring), Aug. 15 (summer), giving you/the VA until the end of the semester to pay your tuition and fees. You will still receive e-bills each month, but KU Enroll & Pay will always show your actual due date. If you get a late fee, it likely means you did not complete your VA request for the semester. Contact us with questions. Ch. 33 Post-9/11 GI Bill users : We first tell the VA just the credit hours you're enrolled in to get your book stipend/housing allowance going. A second certification will occur after the add/drop period with your tuition and fees, as required by law. This means it will take longer for the VA to pay your tuition/fees - that's why we push your deadline back. Ch. 31 VR&E users : VA should pay everything on your Enroll & Pay account, except bookstore charges. Bookstore charges require a separate purchasing process . If you see bookstore charges on your Enroll & Pay account, contact us . Other VA benefits users : The VA will pay nothing on your KU Enroll & Pay account. You are responsible for paying your entire bill. Contact us by Dec. 1/May 1 if you still have charges on your account that you feel should not be there. Why hasn't the VA paid my tuition? Click to expand First, when you complete your KU request for VA benefits each semester, we push your KU tuition/fees deadline back to Dec. 15 (fall), May 15 (spring), Aug. 15 (summer). You will still get e-bills, but Enroll & Pay will always show your actual due date. Ch. 33 Post-9/11 GI Bill & Ch. 31 VR&E users : Did you complete your KU request for VA benefits ? If so, we first tell the VA just your credit hours to get your book stipend and/or housing allowance going. We will report the tuition a bit later, as required by law. This means it may take longer for the VA to pay your tuition/fees. Contact us by Dec. 1 (fall)/May 1 (spring)/Aug. 1 (summer) if you still have charges on your KU account that you feel should not be on there. Other VA benefits users : VA will pay nothing on your KU Enroll & Pay account. You are responsible for paying your entire bill. If I take a short (e.g. 8-week) class, how will that affect my GI Bill benefits? Click to expand Students must be enrolled full time in term-long classes to receive full GI Bill benefits, as your benefits are charged by day. This means short-term and non-standard courses can affect your full-time status and your benefits (e.g. housing allowance if you're using the Post-9/11 GI Bill ). For example, undergraduate students must be in 12 credits that run the whole semester. If you are only in 12 credits and one of those courses starts later (e.g. October), you will be part time until that course starts. If you're in 15 credits and one of the 3 credit hour courses starts later, there is no issue since you're in 12 credits for the entire semester. Before you enroll in short classes, contact us to learn how short courses might affect your benefits. Or see the \"Enrollment Status and Training Time\" section on this web page for more details. Will dropping a class affect my benefits? Click to expand Withdrawing from a class, especially outside the 100% refund window, can result in you owing KU and/or the VA money. This is regardless of which VA benefit you are using. Contact us before dropping a class to understand the potential financial implications. If you have mitigating circumstances , let us know BEFORE you drop the class so that we can inform the VA. If you don't let us know VA will mail you a letter explaining they were notified about your drop. They may ask you to submit any mitigating circumstances that led to the drop. In response, you\u2019ll need to mail the reasons to your Regional Processing Office or send them using the \u201c Submit a Question \u201d button on VA's website. VA will notify you by letter if your reasons are accepted and the amount of any final benefit debt. VA also automatically grants mitigating circumstances for up to 6 credits the first time, and only the first time, you drop classes. You may still owe money, though, even if VA grants you mitigating circumstances. How do I complete monthy enrollment verification for VA benefits? Click to expand The VA requires certain users to verify their enrollments at the end of each month for the time they were in classes. Visit the VA's website to learn more and to verify your enrollment. How much will my books/housing stipend be with the Post-9/11 GI Bill? Click to expand Visit the GI Bill Comparison Tool for specific information. Early Release of Funds: I'm a Post-9/11 GI Bill user who gets additional grants/scholarships/financial aid. Will they affect my VA benefits? How can I get that money before the VA pays tuition? Click to expand It depends on whether you are getting restricted aid or unrestricted aid. Visit our aid page for more information . Post-9/11 GI Bill users: to receive that money while waiting on the VA to pay your tuition and fees, complete the VA Educational Benefits - Early Release of Funds *\u00a0form each semester . *A link to this form is included in the KU request for VA benefits form you complete each semester. How do I update my direct deposit information? Click to expand You can update your direct deposit information in your VA.gov profile. You'll need your bank's routing number and account number to make the updates. For steps on setting up or updating your KU direct deposit information in Enroll & Pay, visit Student Accounts & Receivables . If I run out of GI Bill benefits during the semester, will the VA pay the entire semester? Click to expand It depends. Veterans using the Post-9/11 GI Bill and this is the first VA benefit you have used : Yes, VA should pay for the entire term for all classes that started while you still had benefits left. Veterans who combined benefits (e.g., used 36 months of the Montgomery GI Bill and 12 months of the Post-9/11 GI Bill) and will exceed your 48th month during the semester : VA will only make payments for tuition and BAH up to the last day of that 48th month. Spouses and dependents using Post-9/11 GI Bill : the VA will stop payments on the last day of your benefits (and prorate the tuition/BAH), unless you are the very last family member to use the very last day of benefits. If you're the last family member, VA should pay for the entire term for all classes that started while you still had benefits left. Ch. 35 DEA and Ch. 1606 MGIB-SR students : VA typically stops paying the day you run out of benefits. I am switching VA benefits (e.g. from Post-9/11 GI Bill to VR&E or Ch. 35). Should I do anything differently? Click to expand If you are switching your VA benefits program, complete a \" New KU\u00a0Request for Benefits \" instead of a \"Continued Request\" and upload your new Certificate of Eligibility. Can I use multiple VA benefits at the same time? Click to expand If you qualify for multiple benefits you can only use one at a time, but you can switch which one is active between semesters. To change benefits you can request a new COE through the VA. **There is one exception. Students eligible for Ch. 35 benefits under two parents may use both at the same time. If you elect concurrent payments, you will receive double the rate but be charged double the entitlement for each semester you are certified. To use both Ch. 35 benefits: Apply for the COE for Ch. 35 under both parents. Choose 1 parent\u2019s SSN to enter for the veteran\u2019s SSN. Once you get the COE, call VA ( 888-442-4551 ) to indicate that you want to use both benefits at the same time. VA annotates your record of this (called a work order).\u00a0 This is so when the school enters enrollment, VA will see to process concurrent payments under CH35.\u00a0 Request has to come from you to the VA (the school is not involved with this part). Continue to use the same parent\u2019s SSN info you used before completing the KU continued request for benefits each semester. When we send enrollment info to VA, VA will see the work order and process concurrent enrollment/payment under both parents. Do you offer the Yellow Ribbon program? Click to expand Yes, but most KU students do not need Yellow Ribbon. The VA's Yellow Ribbon program is only for Ch. 33 Post-9/11 GI Bill users at the 100% benefit level paying out-of-state tuition who do not meet the Armed Forces Residency Benefit (AFRB) criteria. Living in Kansas (on or off campus) while going to KU? Apply for in-state tuition rates per AFRB instead of Yellow Ribbon. Using Post-9/11 GI Bill at 100% benefit level, living another state while going to KU AND paying out-of-state tuition? Please complete the Yellow Ribbon Application each academic year. Online students in a flat-rate program? You do not need Yellow Ribbon or AFRB. Non-Ch. 33 user? VA's Yellow Ribbon is not an option for you, but AFRB may be . Note for KUMC students only: KUMC does not currently offer Yellow Ribbon, but does offer AFRB. Visit their Military Residency page to learn more. Need Assistance?

    "text": "Yellow Ribbon Program The Yellow Ribbon program is a VA program only for Ch. 33 Post-9/11 GI Bill users at the 100% rate paying out-of-state tuition and who do not meet the Armed Forces Residency Benefit (AFRB) criteria. Please keep in mind that for most Ch. 33 students, AFRB is the better/more applicable option. Before you complete the Yellow Ribbon form: Confirm you have the Post-9/11 GI Bill at the 100% rate by getting your Certificate of Eligibility (COE) from the VA. Confirm you are NOT eligible for the Armed Forces Residency Benefit (AFRB). If you are AFRB-eligible, it is more beneficial for you to complete the AFRB process and you do not need to do Yellow Ribbon. Complete your KU Request for Benefits form each semester to activate your VA education benefits at KU. The Yellow Ribbon form is NOT a substitute for requesting to use your VA education benefits. Once you have completed these steps, submit your Yellow Ribbon application each academic year.

If, however, the student nevertheless wants to opt out of the fee, the opt-out process is as follows: The student may file a request to opt-out of the eligible class supply fee no later than the 3rd class meeting. The student will initiate the opt-out process by consulting with the professor/instructor of the course.\u00a0 The professor/instructor will cover the potential impact of opting out, the responsibilities the student assumes, and the specific supplies the student will be required to personally acquire for participation in the course. The professor/instructor will provide the student a detailed list of supplies the student must purchase.\u00a0 These materials may not be available for purchase at the KU bookstore. Materials, supplies or equipment may be required for class prior to the date that the student will receive any refund of the fee. Within ten (10) business days after the opt-out form is turned in to the Office of the Registrar, the student\u2019s account will be adjusted in the amount of the class supply fee.\u00a0 Students can access their account detail through Enroll and Pay. Once an opt-out request is submitted, the student has accepted the personal responsibility for acquiring the required supplies.\u00a0 The student will not be allowed to use University-provided supplies.\u00a0 If the student later uses University-provided supplies, the student may be charged the full class supply fee and may be referred to the Student Conduct & Community Standards Office for non-academic misconduct.\u00a0 . Class fees that are eligible for the opt-out process are specifically intended to ensure students\u2019 preparedness for the course and immediate access to learning supplies.\u00a0 Opting out of the class fee and the automatic delivery of supplies may hinder your success in the class and IS NOT RECOMMENDED. *For a list of classes eligible under the Opt-Out policy, please see the Comprehensive Fee Schedule .
