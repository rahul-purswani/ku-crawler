    "text": "KU School of Engineering History It's hard to claim that tradition makes a program better, except when the tradition is one of originality, leadership and constant improvement. The first engineering degree granted in the entire state of Kansas was a degree in civil engineering awarded in 1873 to KU student Murray Harris. Harris was one of four members of the first graduating class at KU. Although KU already had an engineering degree program, the School of Engineering wasn't established until 1891, when the Kansas Board of Regents said \"aye\" and KU became home to the first school of engineering in Kansas. The first dean of engineering was Frank O. Marvin, a civil engineer, namesake of Marvin Hall and a guy with a great mustache. Over the years, degree programs in the School of Engineering have changed to fit the needs of society and trends in education. Mechanical engineering students are no longer expected to spend every day in the Roofs and Bridges class as they did more than 100 years ago. Long gone are programs in metallurgical and mining engineering. The school now offers newer degree programs and concentrations in bioengineering, information technology, project management and interdisciplinary computing. All undergraduate engineering degree programs are accredited through the Accreditation Board for Engineering and Technology. Originally, KU's architecture degree program was administered through the School of Engineering. In 1968, the Board of Regents allowed the university to create the School of Architecture and Urban Design. The close relationship that remains between the schools of Architecture and Engineering is best reflected through the rigorous architectural engineering program offered through the School of Engineering. Today's ARCE students continue to take Architecture studio courses and have the opportunity to pursue both a B.S. in Architectural Engineering and a Master of Architecture degree in six years of study. In 1995, the university's computer science degree programs were moved from the College of Liberal Arts and Sciences into the School of Engineering. The change reflected the increasingly important link between programming development and hardware. The shift also strengthened the continually growing association between all engineering disciplines and computer science. Newer programs in interdisciplinary computing allow students to harness the power of computers to further discovery in a field of science, such as biology or physics. Today, the emphasis in the KU School of Engineering is on interdisciplinary research. Engineers and computer scientists from different disciplines work together to provide innovative solutions to challenges around the world. New research centers headquartered at KU - the NSF Center for Remote Sensing of Ice Sheets, the Center for Environmentally Beneficial Catalysis and the KU Transportation Research Institute - all put the focus on interdisciplinary efforts to find the best solutions. These centers and many other laboratories provide KU engineering and computing students, faculty and staff with outstanding opportunities for personal and professional growth. The School of Engineering has more than 100 faculty members, many of whom have achieved the honor of Fellow within their professional associations. KU is the only university in the state with faculty in the National Academy of Engineering. In 1978, the school established an advisory board to help the school ensure its graduates receive an education that makes them competitive in the workforce. The board consists of influential and sagacious people - many of them alumni - in business, industry, government and education. The board provides guidance in planning and organizing the school's activities and in identifying opportunities and developing resources. KU engineering and computing students come from Kansas and beyond. In fact, engineering and computing students represent more than 50 countries. The students say they chose the KU School of Engineering for its excellent reputation, strong programs in their major, close contact with faculty, opportunities for research and student projects, affordability, quality of the facilities and friendly atmosphere. Women make up nearly 22 percent of the undergraduate student body and 24 percent of graduate students. What's in store for the future? The history is still to be written. What we can say is that it will include some of the best ideas ever imagined.",

    "text": "Academic Standing In the KU School of Engineering, we are committed to supporting students as they work towards their degree. One piece of that support is making sure that students are making progress towards the engineering degree. Each fall and spring semester when grades post, the School of Engineering reviews each student's academic progress including review of attempted hours, semester and cumulative GPA, and progress toward an engineering degree. School of Engineering Rules & Regulations, Section 3r What is academic standing? We know that for students to be successful in their journey towards an engineering degree, students need to earn at least a 2.0 GPA each semester. Students also need to earn grades of C or better in all their math, science, and engineering coursework to prepare for their future coursework and to stay on track for graduation in a timely manner. Students may be placed on probation if one of these criteria are not met. Probation\u00a0is not a disciplinary action. The School of Engineering works closely with your engineering department and academic advisor\u00a0to help identify what obstacles might prohibit you form achieving your best, along with implementing strategies for how to improve. An engineering degree is academically rigorous; it is not uncommon for a student to struggle at some point in their academic career. Most of those students will make the changes needed and be back on track in the next semester. Your Success in Engineering Areas of needed improvement are different for each student. We recommend working with your advisor and engineering department to find ways to improve. Successful engineering students have shared strategies that helped them get back on track. Below are potential areas for you to incorporate for your academic success. Plan. Set realistic expectations for course load. Some students can succeed carrying 18 credits a semester; others may carry 12 credits to get the grades they need. How many credit hours can you successfully complete with your other obligations? Your education isn\u2019t a race. Talk with your advisor to figure this out. Support. Get help early and often. There are many resources at KU and in Engineering to help you succeed, with academics and your general well-being at Academic Resources . Advisors and instructors aren\u2019t just there to help you in your classes, they are there to also help you in life. Communicate . Talk with your professors and graduate teaching assistants. They are there to help you succeed. Talk to them before you need help, and certainly when you don\u2019t understand something in class. Visit your professor or GTA's office hours and attend review sessions if offered for the course. Collaborate . If you are not doing this already, make new friends in your classes\u2014form study groups and support one another. Also, get involved in a club at KU. Other students can be a wealth of experience to help you through those tough classes. Persevere. An engineering degree is hard to earn, as are many things in life worth having. Don\u2019t give up. You can do it with the right tools, support, and attitude, but it is going to take effort. Information about Academic Standing What does academic standing mean for me? Click to expand Students may be placed on notice, placed on probation, then continue on probation after the initial probation semester, and also return to good standing. Returning to good standing means a student satisfied all probation requirements and is making satisfactory academic progress toward their engineering degree. Students are given criteria for their probationary period; they are expected to earn at least a 2.0 semester GPA\u00a0 as they work to bring up their overall GPA, make satisfactory progress toward their engineering degree. Individual course grades including Ds, Fs, and Ws are monitored. Most students are able to return to good standing quickly. Students who are unable to improve or recover are at risk of dismissal. Students who are dismissed from the School of Engineering will be unable to progress in an engineering degree until they are eligible to be readmitted. How do I become readmitted to the School of Engineering after academic dismissal? Click to expand After a student is dismissed from the School of Engineering, the College of Liberal Arts and Sciences (CLAS) may consider them for admission after review of their record. Students with less than a 2.00 university cumulative GPA may not be admitted. In general, students need to meet School of Engineering readmission requirements .\u00a0If a student does not meet the readmission requirements, they will need to contact their engineering department about an amended path foward to readmission/graduation. Students will be given criteria to meet by their engineering department for readmission which could include course retakes, expected grades in courses, or raising your cumulative and semester GPA. If a student is not admitted to the College, they will not be able to attend KU until they are readmitted to the university. Engineering Dismissal Appeal The Associate Dean for Academic Affairs in the School of Engineering considers appeals for undergraduate students' academic standing dismissal due to extenuating or mitigating circumstances. If eligible, submit a form here . Contact Alex Pang with questions. Understanding Your Academic Standing Click to expand Placed on Notice (PNTC) A first-year, first semester student whose university overall or engineering grade-point average is between 1.75 and 1.99 will be placed on academic notice. Academic notice serves as the warning system to recognize and make improvements to academic performance. Students placed on academic notice are monitored by the school, engineering department, and student\u2019s academic advisor to sustain outreach and resources for the student. A first-year freshman student placed on academic notice after their first semester will either return to good standing after the subsequent semester dependent on university and engineering semester and cumulative GPAs above 2.00. If a student placed on academic notice does not return to good standing after the subsequent semester, the student will then be placed on probation. Placed on Probation (POP) A student is placed on academic probation when any semester, cumulative, or engineering GPA is less than 2.00. Continued on Probation (COP) A student will be continued on probation if their semester GPA is above 2.00, but their overall university or engineering GPA is less than 2.00. Return to Good Standing (RGS) A student on probation may be returned to good standing if: In the next semester, the semester, cumulative, and engineering GPA are above 2.00 while making progress toward the engineering degree; OR Earned grades in relevant mathematics, science, and engineering courses applicable to the degree allow the student to progress according to the grading policy implemented by the department from which the course was offered. Dismissal (DIS) A student on probation may be dismissed for failure to make progress toward their engineering degree while earning a GPA lower than 2.00 in the next semester, or for failure to have a university overall and engineering overall GPA of 2.00 or greater for two consecutive semesters. A student within one semester of completing degree requirements who is recommended for dismissal is subject to review by the engineering department and school to instead continue on probation.

    "text": "Academic Misconduct Academic Integrity An understanding of academic integrity is integral to the University of Kansas School of Engineering. Academic integrity is a cornerstone of the university\u2019s mission: to life students and society by educating leaders, building healthy communities and making discoveries that change the world. The vision of the university to be an exceptional learning community that lifts each member and advances society is supported by our values of integrity, respect, innovation, stewardship, and excellence. Academic integrity involves a commitment from engineering students, faculty, and staff to investigate, prosecute, and punish academic misconduct when it occurs. The aim of this guide is to inform students about the importance of academic integrity and the academic misconduct process. Academic integrity is based on five fundamental values: honesty, trust, fairness, respect, and responsibility. Honesty is the foundation of teaching, learning, research, and service and is the prerequisite for trust, fairness, respect and responsibility. It is more than personally not cheating on assignments; it is not tolerating cheating from anyone. Trust encourages the free exchange of ideas. It is promoted when faculty set clear guidelines for assignments and for evaluating student work; by students who prepare work that is honest and thoughtful; and by schools that set clear and consistent academic standards. Fairness is everyone's responsibility and a lapse by one member of the community does not excuse misconduct by another. Fair and accurate evaluation is essential in the educational process. Respect is paramount to learning process and respecting people involves fairness and honest treatment. Students show respect by attending class, being on time, paying attention, listening to other points of view, being prepared, meeting academic deadlines and performing to the best of their ability. Faculty show respect by taking students' ideas seriously, providing full and honest feedback of their work, valuing their aspirations and goals and recognizing them as individuals. Responsibility is being personally accountable for your behavior. Being responsible means taking action against wrongdoing, despite peer pressure, fear, loyalty or compassion. Responsibility is part of academic civility. Procedures Glossary of Terms Click to expand Complainant (n): a person, group, or company that makes a complaint, as in a legal action. Charged party (n): a person who is charged with an alleged form of academic misconduct. Sanction (n): a penalty for disobeying a law, rule, or policy. Hearing panel (n): composed of 3 faculty members and 2 students outside of the charged party\u2019s engineering department that will hear the case and write a recommendation to the Dean and/or Associate Dean regarding the alleged academic misconduct. What is Academic Misconduct? Click to expand Pursuant to Article 2, Section 7 of University Senate Rules and Regulations , 2.7.1 Academic misconduct by a student shall include, but not be limited to, disruption of classes; threatening an instructor or fellow student in an academic setting; giving or receiving of unauthorized aid on examinations or in the preparation of notebooks, themes, reports or other assignments; knowingly misrepresenting the source of any academic work; unauthorized changing of grades; unauthorized use of University approvals or forging of signatures; falsification of research results; plagiarizing of another's work; violation of regulations or ethical codes for the treatment of human and animal subjects; or otherwise acting dishonestly in research. Academic misconduct by an instructor shall include, but not be limited to, grading student work by criteria other than academic performance, willful neglect in the discharge of teaching duties, falsification of research results, plagiarizing of another's work, violation of regulations or ethical codes for the treatment of human and animal subjects, or otherwise acting dishonestly in research. Academic Misconduct Process Click to expand An attempt shall be made to resolve the issue directly with the student. An instructor may impose a sanction of censure-warning, reprimand, or reduction of grade. The Dean or Associate Dean may impose more severe sanctions including: transcript citation of academic misconduct, suspension from a specific course, suspension from the University of Kansas, and expulsion from the University of Kansas. After a charge of academic misconduct is filed, a hearing will only be scheduled if the student wishes to deny the charge and/or appeal the recommended sanction. If the student admits to the charge and does not wish to appeal the sanction, the sanction may be imposed immediately. When an instructor determines that a student has violated academic integrity, the instructor may charge the student with academic misconduct by completing the academic misconduct form . The instructor must complete and submit the form within 21 calendar days from the point of the discovery. Any reduction in a student\u2019s grade due to academic misconduct must be accompanied by the completed form. Recommended sanctions by the instructor can include one or more of the following: Censure-written warning or reprimand Reduction of grade for specific work (Indicate grade: zero, F, D, or other) Reduction of grade of the course (Indicate grade: zero, F, D, or other) Not eligible for course repeat policy, withdrawal, or retroactive withdrawal Alleged students will be notified of the charge of academic misconduct within 30 days of the instructor\u2019s filing of charges. Alleged students are given 10 calendar days to review the document and determine their response. Failure to respond within 10 calendar days of notification is judged to indicate the student\u2019s agreement with the charge and sanctions. If a student admits to the charge and does not wish to appeal the recommended sanctions, the charge and sanctions are processed and imposed immediately. If a student wishes to deny the charge and/or appeal the recommended sanctions, the Associate Dean and/or their academic integrity officer will schedule a hearing. Hearing Procedures Click to expand Each party may have a supportive friend or representative in attendance at the hearing. However, the academic integrity officer and/or the chair of the hearing panel must be informed at least 24 hours in advance of the hearing. If the representative is a lawyer, the University General Counsel will be informed and asked to attend the hearing. Witnesses are allowed. One witness as a time may be called by the complainant, the person charged, or the hearing panel. A hearing may be held even if one or both parties fail to appear. The hearing shall be conducted with the following outline: Introduce the hearing panel members, the complainant, the charged party, and any representatives. Explain the hearing procedures. The charged party may choose to remain silent and not reply to the charges. Review the charges which led to the hearing, including possible sanctions. Allow the complainant to explain the alleged incident or event which led to the charge of academic misconduct. Allow the charged party to reply and explain the alleged incident or event. Hear any witnesses. The two parties may question one another and any witnesses appearing. Hearing panel members may also ask questions of either party and of any witness at any time. The complainant has the responsibility to persuade the panel by a preponderance of evidence that an act of academic misconduct has occurred. The hearing proceedings will be audio recorded. Immediately after the hearing, the panel will reach a determination of their recommendations of specific sanctions, if any. The chair of the panel will compile comments, rationale, and recommendations in writing and forward them to the Dean and/or Associate Dean within seven calendar days. The Dean and/or Associate Dean shall review the report from the hearing panel, its recommendation, and any other relevant information and may impose the sanctions of admonition, warning, or censure upon a student and reduction of grade, or disciplinary probation upon a student, and with notice of the Provost, a sanction of suspension or dismissal of a student. The determination of the charge and any sanction shall be communicated in writing to the two parties involved within 30 days of the hearing. Within 30 days after receipt of notice of action, either party may appeal the action to the University Senate\u2019s Judicial Board. Academic Grade Appeals Click to expand A student may initiate a grade appeal for a final course grade after the student has made an effort to resolve the problem by appealing directly to their instructor. This is in the case if the student believes there has been an improper application of the grading procedure announced for the course by the instructor, as explained in the course syllabus. The appeal form must be completed within the two months following the first day of the subsequent semester (summer courses excepted) as outlined in the School of Engineering Rules & Regulations (3r.2.3) .\u00a0More information about the grade appeal process can be found in the University Senate Rules & Regulations (2.3.5) . Submit an academic grade appeal. School of Engineering Academic Integrity Committee The Engineering Academic Integrity Committee plays an integral role in the adjudication of formal student academic misconduct cases and ensures students are given the opportunity to have their cases heard by members of the KU Engineering community. Representatives serve on hearing panels of five throughout the year to determine student(s) responsibility for alleged violations of academic misconduct and confirm\u00a0appropriate sanctions if necessary.\u00a0We rely on faculty and student volunteers to serve as panel members. Student Application for the Academic Integrity Committee Faculty Volunteer Form for Academic Integrity Committee Confidentiality All alleged instances of academic misconduct are to remain confidential between the student, instructor, hearing panel, and academic misconduct officer.

    "text": "Undergraduate Graduation Information Graduation Tasks to Complete Graduating students have a few tasks to complete when they are ready to graduate. This includes completing all remaining degree requirements satisfactorily, applying for graduation in Enroll & Pay, indicating participation in the engineering recognition ceremony, and purchasing regalia. 1. Complete all remaining degree requirements Graduation requirements are different at each degree level (Bachelor\u2019s, Master\u2019s and Doctoral degrees). Students are encouraged to talk to their academic advisor when they are ready to complete any milestone in their academic career. The School of Engineering Dean\u2019s staff, in cooperation with departmental staff, is responsible for processing graduation each semester and coordinates the Engineering Recognition Ceremony in the fall and spring. All Students should refer to KU\u2019s Academic Catalog to review degree requirements for their program and the Academic Calendar to be sure they meet posted deadlines for graduation requirements. Students who wish to have a graduation check in the semester prior to their degree completion can schedule an appointment with their JAA academic advisor through Jayhawk GPS , or contact their department. Students will not graduate until all requirements are met. 2. Apply for Graduation This application in Enroll & Pay is for your degree and alerts School and University staff. The deadline to apply for graduation in Enroll & Pay for fall is November 1 and for spring is March 1 . 3. Review Engineering Recognition Ceremony Information RSVP for the engineering winter (December) or spring (May) recognition ceremony if you intend to \"walk\" in that ceremony. The RSVP form is updated each semester for each ceremony. 4. Regalia Purchases If you are walking, make arrangements for any regalia you need . Students cannot participate in any KU graduation ceremony without regalia. Graduation with Distinction & Highest Distinction Each school awards graduation with distinction or graduation with highest distinction . No more than the upper 10 percent of the graduating class may graduate with distinction. No more than 3 percent of the graduating class may graduate with highest distinction. Students must have completed at least 64 hours graded A through F in residence at KU (including the hours in which they are enrolled during the semester of graduation). Awards of distinction and highest distinction are based solely on the grade-point average determined by KU residence credit hours unless the overall grade-point average (including transfer hours) is lower than the residence grade-point average. In this case, the award is determined by the overall grade-point average. Students who rank in the upper 10 percent of their graduating class graduate with distinction. The upper third of those awarded distinction graduate with highest distinction. Degrees Posting & Diplomas Students' degrees are first posted to their transcript after School and University officials verify degree requirements are completed. Diplomas are provided to students who have met all graduation requirements by the stated deadlines from the academic calendar for the semester. When students complete the Application for Graduation, they are given the option to have the diploma mailed to them or pick it up in person. Further information about obtaining your diploma can be found on the Office of the Registrar\u2019s webpage. If you require proof of degree prior to your diploma becoming available , you may request a Statement of Forthcoming Degree . The Statement of Forthcoming Degree is an official document from the University of Kansas verifying that all degree requirements have been met, though the degree has not yet been conferred. This document can only be requested after completing all degree requirements between degrees posting on transcripts. There is a charge for this form. Students will be billed through Enroll & Pay. Contact your engineering academic services staff member to request the necessary endorsements before submitting the form to the Registrar.

    "text": "Enrollment Information All graduate students in the School of Engineering are required to be enrolled each fall and spring semester to remain in good academic standing. Note that this does not include the summer semester, unless you are a PhD candidate (post-comprehensive enrollment requirements) or have a GTA/GRA appointment. This includes part-time and international students, but does not include non-degree seeking students. If you do not plan to enroll in a given semester, you will need to request a Leave of Absence or Voluntarily Discontinue through your department or program. If you fail to complete the request within a given semester, you will be automatically discontinued, and you will need to complete a Permit to Re-Enroll should you return within two semesters. If you are absent for more than three consecutive semesters (counting the summer) you will be required to re-apply to the program. Students who are not enrolled before the first day of classes will receive a late enrollment fee and may have additional requirements to complete enrollment. New students will generally enroll on or after New Graduate Student Orientation , each fall and spring semester. Full time enrollment for graduate students is defined by the university as 9 credit hours of enrollment for fall/spring semesters and 6 hours in the summer. International students and students receiving financial aid may be required to enroll full-time each semester. Students working as a GTA or GRA are required to enroll in 6 credit hours each fall and spring, and 1-3 credit hours each summer to be eligible for employment. Master's students in the final semester, working as a GRA only, and doctoral candidates who have completed their post-comp enrollment requirements may be eligible to enroll in fewer hours by completing the eligibility forms found on the Graduate Studies webpage. If you have questions about your enrollment requirements, please contact KUEngrGrad@ku.edu or call 785-864-1952 . Learn more about enrollment requirements and policies (PDF) . Related Policies: Full-time Enrollment (Graduate Students) Progress to Degree GTA / GRA / GA Information (Graduate Studies) Post-Comprehensive Enrollment (Doctoral Candidates) Frequently Asked Questions about Enrollment Breaks for Graduate Students Am I required to enroll as a graduate student each semester? Click to expand All graduate students are required to enroll for fall and spring semesters to remain in good academic standing. This includes part-time students, but not non-degree seeking students. Summer enrollment is not a requirement unless you are working as a Graduate Research Assistant (GRA) or you are planning to graduate in the summer semester (regular deadline). What is the difference between a Leave of Absence and choosing to Voluntarily Discontinue? Click to expand Leave of Absence \u2013 Use this option when you will be returning to your graduate program after one or more semesters. A Leave of Absence may be granted upon request to the graduate program in advance of the leave. Leaves may be granted in cases of illness, emergency, to pursue family responsibilities, or to pursue full-time activities related to long-range professional goals. To request a Leave of Absence, you must contact your department graduate assistant and provide information on why a leave is requested. A leave must be requested before the 20th day of class. Voluntarily Discontinue \u2013 Use this option if you do not plan to return to your graduate program in the School of Engineering. This means that you voluntarily resign from a program by requesting a discontinuance. If you choose to return at a later date, you must reapply for admission. Discontinuance is requested through your department or program. Why do I need to take a Leave of Absence? Click to expand The university needs to be able to track graduate students\u2019 progress, and all students must be in an approved \u201cgraduate student\u201d category. Detailed information about this policy is available in the Graduate Catalog under \u201cenrollment.\u201d This policy helps to ensure that you do not exceed your maximum tenure due to unforeseen delays in your graduate program. Failure to complete a master\u2019s degree in 7 years, a doctoral degree in 8 years, or both a master\u2019s and a doctoral degree in 10 years at KU may lead to dismissal due to lack of progress, and the program clock stops while students are on a Leave of Absence. How long can I take a Leave of Absence? Click to expand You can request a leave of absence for a maximum of 1 year. Additional requests will be considered after the first year. Please keep in mind that you must re-apply for admission if your absences amount to a period of five years. When do I need to complete a Leave of Absence? Click to expand You should contact your department or program assistant prior to the start of the semester you plan to be absent, and no later than the 20th day of class. Inactive students are automatically discontinued after the 20th day of class, and failure to be in good academic standing may result in dismissal. If in doubt, you are advised to request a Leave of Absence. You may always enroll later if you decide to do so. How do I request a Leave of Absence? Click to expand You need to contact your department or program assistant as soon as you know you will not be enrolling in a future semester. Be sure to tell the assistant why you will be absent and when you plan to return. For specific details, see the \u201cLeave of Absence\u201d explanation under question #2 above. It is also very important that you have updated contact information in Enroll & Pay so that we may contact you if necessary during your absence. How do I update my contact information if my KUID has been deactivated because I wasn\u2019t enrolled for a semester? Click to expand Students can reactivate their account themselves, information can be found\u00a0online\u00a0on the KU Information Technology\u00a0website or contact the University Registrar\u2019s office if still unable to log into Enroll and Pay to update personal information. What do I do when I want to return from a Leave of Absence and re-enroll? Click to expand Notify your department or program assistant of your planned return date and the assistant will complete the necessary paperwork to reactivate your enrollment capabilities. This process may take up to 2 weeks, so please notify the department or program as soon as you know you will be returning. Please keep in mind that late enrollment fees may accrue if you do not initiate this process ahead of time. What happens if I want to return earlier or later than initially planned? Click to expand In both cases, you need to notify your department or program assistant. They will complete the necessary paperwork to complete your request. What happens if I decided to voluntarily discontinue and later change my mind and want to return? Click to expand You will have to re-apply to your program. If you are re-admitted, the associate dean for research and graduate programs will work with your program to determine which credits will count toward your degree. It is important that you only choose to voluntarily discontinue if you are sure that you do not want to complete your degree. If you have any questions about taking a Leave of Absence or volunteering to discontinue, you should contact your advisor, departmental graduate advisor, or engineering graduate division staff at 785-864-1952 to discuss your enrollment options. Do I need to pay a reactivation fee when I want to return from a leave of absence? Click to expand No. If you were on a Leave of Absence, you do not need to request reactivation from the University Registrar. Once you notify your department advisor or assistant that you plan to return, he or she will complete the necessary paperwork for your account to be reactivated. No fee is attached unless you do not allow your department or program enough time to process your return before the first day of class, in which case you may be assessed late enrollment fees. If you do not request a Leave of Absence, you would be required to re-apply for admission to the program and pay a reactivation fee.",

    "text": "Graduate Graduation Information Recognition Ceremonies + KU Commencement KU Engineering hosts two recognition ceremonies each year. Guest do not need tickets for either ceremony. Special seating is available for guests with limited mobility. For the spring ceremony, to ensure all guests with mobility concerns are accommodated, we ask that parties limit their use of reserved seating to those who need it and one additional companion. The university hosts the University of Kansas Commencement in the spring semester. All students who have graduated in that class (which includes summer, fall, and spring graduates) are invited to attend the university\u2019s official ceremony, which takes place the Sunday after finals in the spring semester. As you prepare to complete your graduate program in the School of Engineering, there are several important steps to follow. Because graduation requirements are different at each degree level (Bachelor\u2019s, Master\u2019s and Doctoral degrees), students are encouraged to talk to their departmental/program coordinator in advance when they are ready to complete a milestone in their academic career. In cooperation with departmental/program staff, the School of Engineering Dean\u2019s staff is responsible for processing graduation each semester and coordinates the Engineering Recognition Ceremony in the fall and spring. All Students should refer to KU\u2019s Academic Catalog to review degree requirements for their program and the Academic Calendar to be sure they meet posted deadlines for graduation requirements. Preparing to Graduate The School of Engineering Dean's staff, departmental/program faculty and staff, and students each play a major role in the graduation process. It is important to understand the roles and responsibilities that each unit plays in the graduation process: Students Students should utilize the degree timelines, the graduation checklist and Academic Calendar as a guide to all enrollment and degree requirements and deadlines. While departments and Dean\u2019s staff make every effort to provide information and assistance, it is ultimately the student's responsibility to ensure that all degree requirements have been met and necessary documentation submitted by the semester deadline for degree completion. It is also the student\u2019s responsibility to schedule academic milestones (i.e. final exams and defenses) at least 3 weeks in advance of the date of the exam. This is done by contacting the department/program coordinator with your exam date, time, exam location, and committee members. The 3-week timeline provides ample time for both the department/program coordinator and the Dean\u2019s staff to approve degree eligibility and process exam outcomes. Failure to schedule academic milestones at least 3 weeks in advance can result in a delaying the final exam/defense to the following semester, thus delaying graduation. Departmental/Program Staff The departmental/program staff provide confirmation to the Dean\u2019s staff that all degree requirements have been met by approving the graduation checklist, and work with their individual faculty to resolve any outstanding grade issues. Departments must also observe the universities deadline to submit outcomes of final exams/defenses and approve graduation in Enroll & Pay for the University Registrar to process the degree conferral. School of Engineering Dean\u2019s Office The Dean\u2019s staff reviews a student\u2019s academic file to ensure all items on the graduation checklist are completed by the\u00a0Application for Graduation\u00a0deadline, which can be found on the Academic Calendar . Any requirement not submitted or submitted after the deadline will cause the student's graduation to be postponed to a later semester and may require additional enrollment. In addition to the checklist items, the Dean\u2019s staff verifies final degree certification in the following ways: The resolution of any Incomplete, Missing or Waiting grades Final GPA of 3.0 or above after all grades post (this takes place after the graduation deadline) Verifies a complete and approved plan of study on file Satisfactory completion of the final exam or defense Submission of the thesis or dissertation (initial uploading of thesis or dissertation and required changes from university administrator) Graduation Requirements By\u00a0Degree All graduate degree graduation requirements vary by degree: Doctoral Degree Requirements \u201cApply to Graduate\u201d for the correct semester in Enroll & Pay Log into Enroll & Pay .

    "text": "Plan of Study All graduate students in the School of Engineering, on both the Lawrence and Edwards campuses, must have a completed Plan of Study on file by the beginning of their second semester of graduate study. New students should meet with their faculty advisor or graduate director to develop a Plan of Study before completing the online form. Create a plan Plan of Study Process Students meet with faculty advisor or graduate director to develop a Plan of Study (list of courses that meet graduation requirements) Access the online Plan of Study and make sure that Cookies are enabled Select degree - students will be asked to fill in their KUID, major, contact information, KU employment, thesis/dissertation topic (or type non-thesis), previous degrees, admit term, and number of hours needed to complete their degree Select committee - master's students are required to enter in at least three committee members, and doctoral students are required to enter at least five committee members including one outside member. More information about committees can be found in the Graduate Academic Catalog . Students who have members on their committee outside or new to KU will need to: a) Search for the individual within the database b) Add the individual to the committee or click 'Propose New Committee Member' to add in this person's information. Committee members outside of KU will be sent information about how to log-in to the online Plan of Study system. Be sure contact information and email are correct when proposing a new member. It is important that students meet with their advisor or graduate director to determine who will be on the committee before completing this step, although members can be changed/updated at any point. Enter courses - enter the planned courses required to complete a degree; students should enter this information to the best of their ability after meeting with their advisor or graduate director and update information as it changes. Submit plan - this option will only appear after steps 1-5 are completed . If major changes are made to your plan after your plan was initially approved, it will need to be re-submitted for approval in your last year of graduate study or prior to any milestone. Note: If your personal information (phone or address) is listed incorrectly, we may be unable to contact you with important enrollment or graduation information. Be sure this information is kept up to date in both your plan and in Enroll & Pay. Electronic Approval Process Departmental graduate advisors and personnel will be notified via e-mail when a student has submitted a Plan of Study. A link to the student's Plan of Study will be provided in the e-mail, which is automatically sent to each member of the committee. Committee members will be required to log in to the Plan of Study system to access the student's records. KU committee members will use their KU ID and password to log in to view, approve, deny, or suggest changes to a student's Plan of Study. Committee members outside of KU will be provided with a username and password to log in to the system via email. E-mails, which contain a link to a student's Plan of Study, will be sent to the following individuals in numerical order: Committee Chair Committee members - The committee chair receives an e-mail before notification is sent to each committee member. Committee members will only receive e-mail notifications once the chair has approved the student's plan. Departmental graduate advisor/director Departmental graduate personnel Students will receive e-mail notification after their plan has been approved by all members of the committee. If you do not receive an email within two weeks of submitting your plan, please contact those instructors by email to remind them to review and sign off on your plan. It is important that you do not make changes to your plan after submitting the plan prior to final approval. Doing so will disrupt the automatic email system and may delay approval. Wait until the plan is approved to update or change information and resubmit if needed. Changes to a Student's Plan of Study Students are responsible for updating their Plan of Study when modifications are needed. Committee members who desire changes to a student's plan should notify the student, who will update the online plan. The Committee Chair will be notified when major changes to a student's plan have been submitted for approval. For full committee members to approve a modified plan, students will need to resubmit to the entire committee to approve (or not approve) the updated plan.",

    "text": "Progress Toward Degree Academic Status All graduate students fall into one of the following academic categories: regular, provisional, probationary, or dismissed / discontinued. Students on regular status are not restricted and have no expectations beyond their enrollment and degree requirements. Students placed on academic probation are required to complete those expectations (set by their degree program) to gain regular status and may not be eligible for GTA/GRA funding. Students who are dismissed or choose to leave the university (voluntarily discontinued) are required to re-apply should they decide to return to their graduate study at KU and have little or no access to university resources and enrollment. All active graduate students are required to be continuously enrolled in the fall and spring semesters . Note that this does not include the summer semester, unless you are a PhD candidate or have a GTA/GRA appointment. This includes part-time and international students, but does not include non-degree seeking students. Request a Leave of Absence Click to expand Use this option when you will be returning to your graduate study after one or more semesters. A leave of absence may be granted upon request to the graduate program in advance of the leave. Leaves may be granted in cases of illness, emergency, to pursue family responsibilities, or to pursue full-time activities related to long-range professional goals. The time taken for a leave of absence does not count against the time limit for earning the degree. However, if the total time for the leave extends more than three semesters, you may lose your place in the program and have to re-apply for admission. To request a leave of absence, you must contact your department graduate assistant, who will submit a Progress-to-Degree (PtD) form. You will need to provide the assistant with the following information: non-KU email address, mailing address, first term of leave and the semester you plan to return, as well as a statement on the reason for the leave of absence ( via email). Request to Voluntarily Discontinue Click to expand Use this option if you do not plan to return to your graduate program in the School of Engineering. This means that you voluntarily resign from a program by requesting discontinuance. If you choose to return at a later date, you must re-apply for admission. Discontinuance is requested through your department or program via email to the department/program graduate assistant. All of this information can be found in the Graduate Catalog , under \"enrollment.\" If you are unable to enroll, I strongly suggest that you speak with your graduate advisor before making a decision to take a leave of absence or discontinue. It is equally important that you have an up to date permanent e-mail address and mailing address in Enroll & Pay, so that we may contact you with important information during your absence. Remember that you must be enrolled the semester that you graduate or the semester prior if you plan to meet the early deadline for graduation. If you have any questions about this policy, the forms required, or graduation or enrollment requirements, please contact the Research & Graduate Programs (RGP) staff at kuengrgrad@ku.edu . Advising Faculty advisors, particularly for doctoral students, play an important role in the students' intellectual development. Every graduate student is expected to work closely with a faculty advisor. Advisors assist students in planning a program of study to meet degree requirements. Students are also encouraged to seek out mentors in addition to their formal faculty advisor, which could include staff, researchers, industry partners and other students. Successful advising and mentoring relationships are characterized by clear expectations, open communication, and a willingness to resolve problems. The resources below can facilitate productive relationships between graduate students and their advisors and mentors. Important Note: The information below should be used as a general guideline to build a student/advisor relationship.\u00a0 These are not requirements, but rather best practices.\u00a0 Every advisor and lab situation is different, so expectations should be discussed and clearly laid out at the beginning of a student\u2019s career to better understand and meet the goals of the academic program, advisor, and student. If an issue arises with an advisor, each program has a designated Graduate and Undergraduate Director/Advisor who is available to help when needed. Setting Expectations & Resolving Conflicts Click to expand Student\u2019s should determine their area of interest and understand how they work best in an advising situation before approaching faculty to inquire/interview for a position within a lab or research center. What are your needs in graduate school and reassess those needs regularly as you develop your skills and understanding within academia. Be open and communicate goals and concerns with your advisor and develop a committee that will help you grow and become a strong researcher or industry professional. Each department/program has opportunities for students to learn new skills, but students may also look beyond their program to the school and university for more general skills building (communication, writing, management, networking, career planning, etc.). At KU, the quality of our graduate education program depends on the professional and ethical conduct of our campus. Although KU is composed of many individual programs and departments, the faculty, staff and students create a community of intellectuals, each offering significant value to the university. As such, they have similar responsibilities and commitment to upholding academic standards and sustaining a creative and positive community, while serving state and local needs. Focusing on the professional academic relationship between faculty and graduate students, the following guidelines below are based on the collective experience and wisdom of many research universities. Their purpose is to serve as a starting point for clear and regular communication about expectations; and to encourage awareness of and commitment to practices that are considered a matter of common sense, courtesy, and basic honesty.

Our History History The University of Kansas School of Engineering has one of the oldest minority recruitment and retention programs on campus. Diversity & Women's Programs 50th Anniversary Celebration - Photo Retrospective An overwhelming shortage of minority students in engineering schools prompted many colleges and universities to establish programs that encourage minority students to pursue careers in engineering.\u00a0\u00a0The KU School of Engineering responded to this shortage by starting SCoRMEBE. SCoRMEBE, the Student Council for Recruiting, Motivation and Educating Black Engineers, was born in 1970. Three African-American engineering students at KU \u2014 William Nunnery, Gene Kendall and Ralph Temple \u2014 sowed the seeds for the program that would attract more minority students through promoting engineering to high school minority students as well as providing academic and financial support to engineering students at the university. Faculty and administration at KU, including, Dr. Don Green, Dr. Floyd Preston and Dean William Smith, helped the program become established and flourish. In 1971, the School of Engineering took its commitment a step further by appointing Dr. William Hogan as the school's first assistance dean of minority affairs. With Hogan at the helm, the program grew and minority enrollment increased. In 1977, SCoRMEBE was named one of the four best minority engineering programs in the country by the committee on Minorities in Engineering, an appendage of the National Research Council. Florence Boldridge\u00a0was hired director of Diversity Programs in 1983 and served until retiring in June 2017.\u00a0Boldridge\u00a0focused on expanding the program to make it even more welcoming to students of diverse backgrounds. In 1987, the School of Engineering established a student chapter of the Society of Hispanic Professional Engineers. In 1990, the office established a student chapter of the American Indian Science and Engineering Society and took on a larger role with the KU chapter of the Society of Women Engineers. In 1995, the office changed its name to reflect its greater diversity. It is now known as Diversity Programs for the School of Engineering. In July 2017 , Andrew Williams was hired as Associate Dean for Diversity, Equity, Inclusion & Belonging to oversee Engineering Diversity & Women's Programs. Early in his tenure he\u00a0reimagined\u00a0and rebranded the program with a new name, IHAWKe. In 2019 , Engineering Diversity & Women\u2019s Programs\u00a0earned national acclaim\u00a0when the American Society for Engineering Education named KU one of 29 institutions across the country to receive an \u2018exemplar\u2019 bronze rating\u2014the highest available classification during the review period\u2014as one of the \u201cnation\u2019s leaders in inclusive excellence.\u201d In 2021, KU Engineering celebrated the 50th anniversary of the establishment of its Diversity & Women's Programs. That same year, the School of Engineering also welcomed Elaina Sutley as Associate Dean of Diversity, Equity, Inclusion & Belonging. She also serves as an associate professor of civil, environmental and architectural engineering. In 2024 , IHAWKe held a dedication ceremony for the Michael G. & Joyce N. Shinn Student Lounge, a newly renovated space for students in Learned 1119. Achievements and Milestones In 1900, Charles A. Reece graduated as the first African-American engineering student from the University of Kansas. Minority Engineering Programs is the first minority scholarship established at the University of Kansas. MEP was the first program of its kind for minority engineering students in the Big Eight. It was the first minority engineering program in the Big Eight to establish a student chapter of the National Society of Black Engineers , NSBE, in 1982. It was the first minority engineering program among Big Eight schools to have a minority professor of engineering as its director. In 1975, it organized and developed the Minority Engineering Symposium for students and corporate representatives. In 1985, it assisted in establishing the first minority engineering program for precollege students, the Mid-America Consortium for Engineering and Science Achievement. It established a Society of Hispanic Professional Engineers , SHPE, chapter in 1987. It established an American Indian Science and Engineering Society , AISES, chapter in 1990. It was granted membership in the National Consortium for Graduate Education for Minorities in Engineering and Science, Inc. (GEM) in 1990. In 1990, MEP was granted membership in the American Association of Blacks in Engineering. In 1990, the student chapter of the Society of Women Engineers was incorporated into MEP. It established one of the first early entry programs for entering minority students on the KU campus. It established closer ties with major corporations for purposes of student internships and permanent positions. It established and dedicated the Minority Engineering Student Study Center. In 2021, Out in Science, Technology, Engineering, and Mathematics became part of IHAWKe. In 2021, IHAWKe hosted a First Generation Lunch for students who identified as First Generation Students. In 2021, KU became a member of the Sloan Indigenous Graduate Partnership, which thanks to funding from the Aldred P. Sloan Foundation, provides fellowships to graduate students who are integrating Indigenous methodologies into their research. In 2023, First Nations Student Association launched the 15th Annual First Nations Launch High-Powered Rocket Competition. Thanks to the generosity of the William Wright Brown Family Foundation, IHAWKe is able to continue the offering the KUEST Bridge Program for 30 students each summer. The KUEST Bridge Program is completely free for students.",

    "text": "University of Kansas awarded $26 million for new Engineering Research Center from National Science Foundation Mark Shiflett, Foundation Distinguished Professor in the Department of Chemical & Petroleum Engineering and director of the Wonderful Institute for Sustainable Engineering, University of Kansas, will lead the EARTH Center. Wed, 08/21/2024 author Cody Howard Share Share by Email Share on LinkedIn Share on Facebook Share on Twitter LAWRENCE \u2014 The National Science Foundation (NSF) has awarded the University of Kansas $26 million to establish a new Gen-4 Engineering Research Center (ERC) \u2014 Environmentally Applied Refrigerant Technology Hub (EARTH) \u2014 that will create a sustainable and circular refrigerant economy. NSF\u2019s Engineering Research Centers bring universities and businesses together to strengthen the competitive position of American industry in the global marketplace. \u201cNSF's Engineering Research Centers ask big questions in order to catalyze solutions with far-reaching impacts,\u201d NSF Director Sethuraman Panchanathan said. \u201cNSF Engineering Research Centers are powerhouses of discovery and innovation, bringing America's great engineering minds to bear on our toughest challenges. By collaborating with industry and training the workforce of the future, ERCs create an innovation ecosystem that can accelerate engineering innovations, producing tremendous economic and societal benefits for the nation.\u201d KU\u2019s ERC EARTH was selected from among hundreds of proposed centers. \u201cWorking closely with industry partners, EARTH will have the resources and expertise to solve the technical, environmental and economic challenges required to create a sustainable refrigerant lifecycle that will benefit Kansans, the nation and the world. In doing this work, the center is a prime example of how the University of Kansas is driving economic development in Kansas,\" said Douglas A. Girod, University of Kansas chancellor. KU is well positioned to lead this effort. \u201cThe University of Kansas has a talented workforce and robust research capabilities,\u201d said Kansas Sen. Jerry Moran. \u201cThis new research center will allow Kansans to lead the way in developing the next generation of refrigerant technology, increasing U.S. competitiveness in an important technology and industry. Through my leadership role on the Senate Appropriations subcommittee which funds federal scientific priorities, I am pleased to help fund the U.S. National Science Foundation, which is critical to advancing U.S. research and development.\u201d KU is the lead institution and is joined by partners at the University of Notre Dame, University of Maryland, University of Hawai'i, University of South Dakota and Lehigh University. Mark Shiflett serves as director for ERC EARTH. Shiflett is a KU Foundation Distinguished Professor in the Department of Chemical & Petroleum Engineering and director of the Wonderful Institute for Sustainable Engineering. \u201cEARTH\u2019s operational design will cultivate inclusive, interdisciplinary research collaborations and foster workforce development. The EARTH team will partner with community colleges and technical schools to ensure availability of the needed workforce at all levels,\u201d Shiflett said. At the heart of ERC EARTH\u2019s work is reimagining the process for heating, ventilation, air-conditioning and refrigeration (HVACR) systems across the globe. EARTH will develop sustainable, accessible and equitable refrigerant technologies and practices through research, education and innovation that will improve quality of life and combat climate change. HVACR systems are widespread throughout society, enabling transportation and preservation of fresh foods, storage of medicines and cooling of buildings. Most current refrigerants are hydrofluorocarbons (HFCs), which have high global-warming potential. As a result of leaks from existing systems and the energy required to operate them, HFCs account for nearly 8% of global greenhouse-gas emissions. In response, the U.S. and 170 other countries are phasing down HFCs in accordance with domestic and international agreements signed in recent years, which creates a tremendous challenge to responsibly and sustainably replace billions of kilograms of refrigerants. ERC EARTH will take a multifaceted approach to address this challenge. \u201cMultidisciplinary research teams will focus on three key areas: promoting the recycling and repurposing of refrigerants, developing transformative refrigerants and creating next-generation cooling and heating technologies with higher energy efficiency,\u201d Shiflett said. At its core, ERC EARTH will address a critical challenge facing society. \u201cThere is a tremendous need to develop cooling/heating technologies that use less energy and new refrigerants that are safe for the environment. EARTH will be a critical national resource to address these challenges. The University of Kansas School of Engineering is proud to be leading this collaboration, which leverages multiple academic and industrial partners,\u201d said Mary Rezac, dean of the KU School of Engineering. This is one of the largest federally funded grants in KU history, with the potential to become the largest if the renewal option is successful. The project is renewable after five years for another $26 million dollars, for a total of 10 years and $52 million.

Thu, 03/27/2025 author Vince Munoz Share Share by Email Share on LinkedIn Share on Facebook Share on Twitter LAWRENCE \u2014 Four University of Kansas professors have been elected as 2024 American Association for the Advancement of Science (AAAS) fellows, a distinct honor within the scientific community. This year\u2019s fellows: Timothy Jackson , department chair and professor of chemistry Ward Thompson , Richard S. Givens Chair and professor of chemistry Jon Tunge , associate chair for graduate studies and professor of chemistry Michael Branicky , former dean of engineering and professor of electrical engineering & computer science. The 2024 class of AAAS fellows includes 471 scientists, engineers and researchers across many disciplines. The fellows are recognized for their scientifically and socially distinguished achievements. \"I want to congratulate Professor Jackson, Professor Thompson, Professor Tunge and Professor Branicky on this prestigious honor,\u201d Chancellor Douglas A. Girod said. \u201cThese four researchers have demonstrated excellence in their fields and have done so in a way that reflects well on our entire university. As one of the nation\u2019s leading research institutions, KU strives to make discoveries that change the world \u2014 and these four scholars are helping us fulfill that mission every day.\u201d Timothy Jackson Timothy Jackson Jackson was recognized for distinguished contributions to the field of bioinorganic chemistry, particularly through the combined use of kinetic, spectroscopic and computational methods to develop electronic structure-activity correlations of bioinspired manganese complexes. His research looks at bioinorganic chemistry, which involves the role of metals in biology, such as how the human body uses iron enzymes to transport oxygen or how plants use manganese enzymes to split water molecules into oxygen and hydrogen. Understanding these reactions can help develop more environmentally friendly methods for the chemical industry. Jackson earned a doctorate in chemistry from the University of Wisconsin-Madison in 2004. Prior to joining KU, he was a National Institutes of Health postdoctoral fellow at the University of Minnesota from 2005 to 2007. Ward Thompson Ward Thompson Thompson was recognized for distinguished contributions in theoretical chemical dynamics and spectroscopy, including seminal studies on chemistry in nanoscale confinement and the calculation of activation energies. His work focuses on understanding chemical dynamics in liquids, namely how, and how fast, molecules move and react. He uses theoretical chemistry to predict experimental results and uncover molecular-level mechanistic information in systems relevant to applications including catalysis, radiation chemistry and geochemistry. Thompson earned a doctorate in chemistry from the University of California-Berkeley in 1996. He was a postdoctoral fellow at the University of Colorado from 1997 to 2000. Jon Tunge Tunge was recognized for the advancement of critical synthetic strategies involving the environmentally benign formation and utilization of organometallics. Jon Tunge His research involves developing methods of promoting chemical reactions with the inherent energy in molecules rather than high-energy reagents or wasteful reagents to trigger chemical reactions. Reagents can often be toxic and expensive, so learning ways of triggering chemical reactions without them can improve economic efficiency and minimize toxic waste in industrial chemistry. Tunge earned a doctorate in chemistry from Columbia University in 2000. He was a postdoctoral associate at the University of Wisconsin-Madison from 2000 to 2002. Michael Branicky Michael Branicky Branicky was recognized for distinguished contributions to modeling, analysis and control of cyber-physical systems, and for applications to networked control systems and robotics. He studies the software that helps machines move. One of Branicky\u2019s research interests involves cyber-physical systems, which help integrate computation and physical components. These systems are applied to a wide range of areas such as agriculture, energy, health care, manufacturing and transportation. Branicky earned a doctorate in electrical engineering and computer science from the Massachusetts Institute of Technology in 1995. Before joining KU as dean, he was a professor and department chair at Case Western Reserve University. Including the four new honorees, KU now has 33 AAAS fellows as active faculty members across all its campuses. To become a fellow, a researcher must be nominated by either one of the AAAS\u2019s 24 steering groups, the organization\u2019s CEO or three previously elected fellows, so long as two of those three fellows are not from the nominee\u2019s institution. The nomination is referred to a relevant steering committee, which sends a list of finalists to the AAAS Council for selection. Earlier this week, Sudip Parikh, CEO of AAAS and executive publisher of the Science family of journals,\u00a0delivered a talk on KU\u2019s Lawrence campus. Parikh shared the science and technology goals identified by the Vision for American Science & Technology Task Force , which he chairs. The group of more than 70 of the nation\u2019s most influential leaders in science, industry, education and philanthropy includes KU's Barbara Bichelmeyer, chief academic officer, provost & executive vice chancellor. The task force recently unveiled a road map guiding the science and technology enterprise to support America\u2019s leadership on an increasingly competitive world stage.

However, Joy Ward received the award in 2008 as a KU faculty member as well. Ward is currently provost and executive vice president of Case Western University. LAWRENCE \u2014 Two University of Kansas professors were recently awarded the highest honor given by the U.S. government to early-career researchers who show great potential for leading scientific advancements in the 21st century. Anthony Fehr, associate professor of molecular biosciences, and Gibum Kwon, associate professor of mechanical engineering, were among the 400 people chosen earlier this year by then-President Joe Biden as recipients of the 2024 Presidential Early Career Awards for Scientists and Engineers (PECASE). Established in 1996, the award comes with a plaque and funding from the researcher\u2019s federal agency for up to five years. Fehr and Kwon are the first two researchers to receive the prestigious award as KU faculty members since 2008, when then-KU faculty member Joy Ward received it. Ward is currently\u00a0the provost and executive vice president of Case Western Reserve University.\u00a0KU also has one previous PECASE winner currently on faculty, Suzanne Shontz, associate dean for research and graduate programs in the School of Engineering, who received the award in 2011 prior to arriving at KU. Anthony Fehr Anthony Fehr Fehr, whose research is funded by the National Institutes of Health, is working on several projects related to coronaviruses and SARS-CoV-2, the virus that causes COVID-19. This includes developing a new SARS-CoV-2 vaccine by deleting or mutating a gene called \u201cMac1,\u201d which is known to help the virus cause disease. He said a live-attenuated vaccine \u2014 a vaccine that uses a weakened form of a virus to stimulate a strong immune response \u2014 that could target the lungs through nasal inhalation would be a powerful weapon to add to the current arsenal of COVID-19 vaccines, which may not last as long or be as effective as live-attenuated vaccines. Fehr\u2019s lab is also developing antiviral medications that target Mac-1 to better understand the basic biology of how this protein leads to severe disease. \u201cAny time you think about a virus infection like the flu or like HIV, there are multiple drugs and vaccines that are being developed to try to combat them,\u201d Fehr said. \u201cIt\u2019s not a one shot kills all, so we have to have a multipronged approach to address this problem.\u201d Arash Mafi, executive dean of the College of Liberal Arts & Sciences at KU, said Fehr\u2019s recognition is a reflection of the top-notch research being conducted at the university. \u201cWe are thrilled that Anthony is being recognized with this prestigious presidential award,\u201d Mafi said. \u201cIt is just another reminder of the high-caliber work being done here that has real-life implications for improving the quality of life of people around the world.\u201d Gibum Kwon Gibum Kwon Kwon\u2019s work, funded by the National Science Foundation, involves synthesizing and testing a novel material capable of removing dissolved substances from water through a selective absorption process. The effectiveness of such materials has been demonstrated for the first time, and the underlying molecular-level mechanisms behind their behavior have been uncovered, representing a breakthrough in water purification technology. In 2020, Kwon received a Faculty Early Career Development (CAREER) Award from the NSF. \u201cThe overarching goal of my research is to address pressing challenges in sustainability through innovative materials,\u201d Kwon said. \u201cBy leveraging materials innovations, I aim to make separation processes more sustainable and versatile, enabling their application across a wide range of industries and processes.\u201d Mary Rezac, dean of the School of Engineering, said the award reaffirms the exceptional work taking place at KU. \u201cGibum\u2019s work is an excellent example of the ongoing world-class research taking place at the School of Engineering in the areas of energy and sustainability,\u201d she said. \u201cThis award is a source of pride for the School of Engineering and the university, and we are thrilled to see him recognized for his efforts.\u201d Jayhawk support Both researchers said they are honored to receive such a prestigious award, and both thanked their funding agencies and credited their teams for their success. \u201cThis is a reflection on everybody in the lab who works here, not just me,\u201d Fehr said. \u201cIt really validates what we do, and I think it\u2019s an incredible honor and hopefully something I can live up to in the future.\u201d Kwon added: \u201cThis achievement would not have been possible without the dedicated efforts of my students, the invaluable advice and encouragement from my colleagues and mentors in the department and the School of Engineering, and the unwavering support of our leadership team.\u201d Fri, 01/31/2025 author Ranjit Arab and Cody Howard Media Contacts Ranjit Arab College of Liberal Arts & Sciences 785-864-7889 ranjit.arab@ku.edu Share Share by Email Share on LinkedIn Share on Facebook Share on Twitter",

Lynch Share Share by Email Share on LinkedIn Share on Facebook Share on Twitter LAWRENCE \u2014 With $5 million in support from the U.S. Department of Energy, the University of Kansas and Avium \u2014 a startup firm founded by researchers from KU\u2019s School of Engineering \u2014 aim to make clean hydrogen more affordable. According to the DoE , the work at KU is part of $750 million in funding for 52 projects across 24 states \u201cto dramatically reduce the cost of clean hydrogen and reinforce American leadership in the growing hydrogen industry.\u201d Green hydrogen is a key tool in the worldwide push to slash carbon emissions, especially in the industrial, transport and agricultural sectors. However, conventional hydrogen production emits greenhouse gases. By contrast, green hydrogen is produced with renewable energy, making it crucial to achieving net-zero goals. \u201cThe whole world is interested in green hydrogen,\u201d said Kevin Leonard, professor of chemical & petroleum engineering at KU, as well as a member of KU\u2019s Center for Environmental Beneficial Catalysis and chief science officer of Avium. \u201cHydrogen is a commodity chemical \u2014 nearly 100 million tons are produced annually worldwide. It\u2019s used in fertilizers, cement production, metal processing and refining. Traditionally, it\u2019s made from natural gas, but that process emits CO 2 . This results in hundreds of millions of tons of greenhouse gas emissions.\u201d Back in 2017, Leonard and KU graduate student Joseph Barforoush\u00a0developed new catalysts that make green hydrogen production more efficient, which led to the founding of Avium, based in Lawrence. \u201cWe've gone through the Small Business Innovation Research grants, receiving funding from both the National Science Foundation and the DoE,\u201d Leonard said. \u201cAs part of the Bipartisan Infrastructure Bill, $750 million was allocated to bolster green hydrogen efforts in the U.S., including the award to Avium and KU.\u201d The work at KU and Avium will develop new catalysts and technologies to improve the efficiency and reliability of green hydrogen production. According to Leonard, the benefits might well extend beyond sectors where hydrogen is already used. \u201cPeople are interested in green hydrogen for traditional applications like those I mentioned, but also for emerging ones,\u201d he said. \u201cOne example is sustainable aviation fuels. Green hydrogen will be critical in creating sustainable, petroleum-free fuels, specifically for aviation.\u201d Kevin Leonard The KU researcher said clean hydrogen is also gaining interest for renewable energy storage. \u201cTake Arizona, for example,\u201d he said. \u201cDuring winter days, the solar panels on the grid can produce much more energy than is needed. However, in the summer, when it\u2019s 110 degrees and air conditioners are running, solar energy alone cannot produce enough electricity, specifically in the evening. Storing excess energy from January and February to use in July and August is a challenge. However, \u00a0using green hydrogen to store that energy, then converting it back to electricity later, may prove effective for grid energy balancing.\u201d KU students and postdoctoral researchers will receive training as part of the work. But further, the award will support technical training and career-building opportunities for students at the Dwayne Peaslee Technical Training Center in Lawrence and Urban Tec in Kansas City, Missouri. \u201cWe\u2019ll collaborate with Peaslee to provide technical training for students entering fields like electrical work and HVAC, ensuring they are familiar with the specialized skills required for green hydrogen processes, such as handling high-voltage lines or understanding the systems involved in hydrogen energy,\u201d Leonard said. \u201cWe are also partnering with Urban Tec to launch the Avium Summer Experience, where students from Kansas City will visit KU to explore university life. They'll also tour Avium and Peaslee Tech to learn about the different paths available to them \u2014 whether through apprenticeships or startup environments.\u201d Leonard said the transition to a clean-energy future, especially the DoE\u2019s stated Hydrogen Shot goal, would depend in part on the development of technology like Avium\u2019s catalysts. \u201cThe U.S. is really pushing towards sustainability,\u201d he said. \u201cThere's a federal target to produce green hydrogen for just a dollar per kilogram by 2031. The point is that green hydrogen will become a key part of the transition to clean energy. Green hydrogen can help make the chemical industry more sustainable by enabling the more sustainable production of fuels and fertilizers.\u201d Tue, 10/29/2024 author Brendan M.

    "text": "New KU Engineering IHAWKe student lounge named for Joyce and Mike Shinn Mike and Joyce Shinn. Thu, 09/12/2024 author School of Engineering Share Share by Email Share on LinkedIn Share on Facebook Share on Twitter LAWRENCE \u2014 A lounge for engineering students that started in a closet in the 1960s is moving into a new, expansive and tech-equipped space, thanks to a foundational $250,000 gift from the widow of a former student who would have smiled at the progress. Michael G. & Joyce N. Shinn Student Lounge in Learned Hall. The new lounge for IHAWKe, the School of Engineering\u2019s Diversity and Women\u2019s Programs, will be named the Michael G. & Joyce N. Shinn Student Lounge. Joyce Shinn made the donation in memory of her husband, Mike Shinn. He was a co-captain of the KU football team \u2014\u00a0earning Academic All-America and dean\u2019s honor roll recognition \u2014 and graduated in 1966 with a degree in aeronautical engineering and went on to a 30-year career at General Electric. He later helped found the KU Alumni Association\u2019s Black Alumni Network as well as the African-American Leaders and Innovators Project. The Mike Shinn Scholars program, launched in 2000, has supported dozens of minority students in earning engineering degrees. \u201cMike always said to family that his grandfather hauled rocks to help build the university and that KU was part of his legacy,\u201d Joyce Shinn said. \u201cHere we are today, three generations down the track, and to know that this lounge will bear the Shinn name in perpetuity is a high honor to Mike\u2019s legacy.\u201d The new lounge is larger and includes more features than the previous lounge space located in LEEP2. The new lounge occupies renovated space inside Learned Hall, a building that opened just as Mike Shinn was making a name for himself in the school and on campus. The new lounge includes beanbag chairs and a big couch in a large lounge area, plus a separate area with a conference table, lots of storage for student groups, games for people to use and play, and smaller tables for homework or study sessions. A large screen and high-quality audio will enable students to participate in meetings remotely, if necessary, and host guest speakers virtually. One connected room provides space for mentoring and study sessions, and another is set aside for meditation, reflection and as a mother\u2019s room. An updated gender-inclusive restroom is next door. Elaina Sutley, associate dean for diversity, equity, inclusion & belonging, noted that it\u2019s quite a change from 1971, when the Student Council for Recruiting, Motivating, and Educating Black\u00a0Engineers was founded and its members met in what had been a typical closet. \u201cFifty-three years later we have a fully renovated, student-designed space for the Diversity and Women\u2019s Programs \u2014 it\u2019s pretty amazing,\u201d Sutley said. \u201cWe are extremely grateful to the Shinn family and honored to dedicate this space to continue their legacy at KU and in the School of Engineering.\u201d In 2004, Mike Shinn earned KU\u2019s highest honor for volunteer service to the university, the Fred Ellsworth Medallion from the KU Alumni Association. That same year, he was elected a KU Endowment trustee and served until the time of his death. In 2008, he was awarded the KU School of Engineering\u2019s Distinguished Engineering Service Award, its highest honor. In 2015, the KU Department of Aerospace Engineering posthumously inducted him into its hall of fame, known as the Honor Roll. Joyce Shinn said that she and her husband were grateful to have both the opportunity and the means to support young people and education. \u201cUsing our God-given talents we\u2019ve been able to give back exponentially, and I pray the students who have graced the halls of KU and who have been recipients of the Shinn engineering scholarship and beneficiaries of Mike\u2019s mentoring will use our example and when they\u2019re established in their careers will do likewise and be inspired to reach back to help others,\u201d she said.

Credit: National Weather Service Fri, 07/19/2024 author Brendan M. Lynch Share Share by Email Share on LinkedIn Share on Facebook Share on Twitter LAWRENCE \u2014 Around the globe, communities at risk from repeated flooding due to climate change are facing stark decisions. Some communities in peril of flooding may resolve, or be urged, to relocate to a safer location \u2014 something known as \u201cmanaged retreat.\u201d In the United States, flood-prone communities in coastal states like Louisiana and Alaska already have commenced managed retreat inland. Elaina Sutley \u201cIt's retreating from risk, and we hope to provide decision support for the equitable implementation of retreat to build climate resilience,\u201d said Elaina Sutley, associate professor of civil, environmental & architectural engineering at the University of Kansas. Sutley is leading a three-year, $650,000 multidisciplinary study of managed retreat as part of a collaboration funded by the National Science Foundation and Canada\u2019s New Frontiers in Research Fund via the 2023 International Joint Initiative for Research on Climate Change Adaptation and Mitigation Competition. Each agency funds the scientists at institutions in their respective countries. The KU-headed partnership is dubbed \u201c Retreating from risk (RFR): Decision-supports for the equitable implementation of retreat to build climate resilience .\u201d Beyond KU, the effort involves Stony Brook and Texas Tech universities as well as researchers abroad. \u201cThis is multidisciplinary collaboration between partners in the United States, Canada and Indonesia, who are all faced with flood disasters, whether that's coastal flooding associated with a hurricane or not,\u201d Sutley said. \u201cInland flooding, seasonal flooding and repeated nuisance flooding \u2014 all three of these countries are facing it. Managed retreat has become a somewhat common adaptation strategy, particularly for flooding. The U.S. team will also consider retreating from wildfire disasters.\u201d While the study of managed retreat will focus on communities suffering from floods and wildfires, Sutley said the work could guide decision making for communities faced with different kinds of repeating natural disasters. \u201cFloods aren\u2019t the only hazard this work is applicable to,\u201d she said. \u201cIn many ways, flooding isn\u2019t much different from a lot of hazards. How can we best move out of a place that is going to be hit repeatedly by disaster and has a record of being hit repeatedly?\u201d The KU researcher said the goal is to understand how managed-retreat approaches are being considered across many geographies, nations and cultures, then identify any key strategies that are shared, as well as understand where there are necessary differences. \u201cThere are many different strategies,\u201d Sutley said. \u201cIn the U.S., one of the most common ways we see managed retreat executed is with the buyout program from FEMA. This project, through our international collaboration, is trying to understand how different cities and governments \u2014 faced with different types of hazards, with different political, social and cultural contexts \u2014 have considered managed retreat. Did they successfully adopt it or one of its strategies? What challenges or barriers did they run into that prevented them from adopting it? What challenges came up when they went through this process? What can we learn within countries across geographies, and then across countries and geographies?\u201d Sutley said the team would take care to seek and incorporate Indigenous knowledge and practices where applicable, partnering with communities that may already have faced relocation or exploitation historically. \u201cThe new Frontiers Research Fund of Canada require that you consider and include Indigenous communities,\u201d Sutley said. \u201cThat's part of some of their equity legislation. It\u2019s key to work with people who have relationships and experience doing this \u2014 taking time to build trust that's needed. Those are going to be key tenets. While the locations we've identified in the United States to partner with aren\u2019t on reservations, for example, they certainly do have people who\u2019ve been disproportionately impacted by historical and modern-day policies and practices that our team is very sensitive to.\u201d From these studies, the collaborating researchers will document political, financial, social, cultural and policy barriers to adopting managed retreat. The study will include data collection via surveys, interviews, focus groups and roundtable discussions, ensuring the work incorporates viewpoints from people involved in the decision-making process at all levels. \u201cHow can we use all of that information to guide future communities who may consider managed retreat as an option?\u201d Sutley said. \u201cWhat are the pros? What are the things that make this a really great option in these different areas? Really, I think we're going to hear very different things from one community to the next but also from one kind of stakeholder in that decision process to the next. So, we're taking more of an open-ended approach.\u201d The results will help guide policymakers, community leaders and future research efforts. The researchers plan to produce \u201ccontextually relevant decision-support tools,\u201d such as a training module, best-practices guidebook or conversation toolkits, to guide community leaders in engaging constituents on managed retreat. Sutley said managed retreat is an urgent issue and the work would yield tools at the end of its three-year span. \u201cAny research that can offer guidance is needed as soon as possible,\u201d she said. \u201cWe're really trying to learn from communities at different stages of dealing with this question \u2014 those who are over and done with it, those at the beginning, and those in the middle. We're studying communities at all these different stages so we can understand how the process unfolds in these different contexts. The findings are meant to be relevant both immediately and long term.\u201d Fri, 07/19/2024 author Brendan M. Lynch Media Contacts Brendan M.

The university\u2019s first satellite, known as \u201cKUbeSat-1\u201d reached orbit late in the evening July 3 when it was launched through NASA\u2019s ELaNa 43 (Educational Launch of Nanosatellites 43) mission. According to NASA, the mission includes eight CubeSats flying on Firefly Aerospace\u2019s Alpha rocket for its \u201cNoise of Summer\u201d launch from Space Launch Complex-2 at Vandenberg Space Force Base, California. This marks the first time an institution from Kansas has launched a small satellite under this program. \u201cThis launch brings a dream to reality for the 70 students directly involved, the alumni who have generously supported the mission and all peer classmates,\u201d said Rick Hale, professor and chair of the Department of Aerospace Engineering. \u201cA successful orbital mission will open the door to sustained design-build-test-operate activities in orbital remote sensing that mimic our sustained success in suborbital remote sensing.\u201d CubeSats are tiny \u201cnanosatellites\u201d about the size of a loaf of bread, weighing in around 3 pounds with each unit about 10 centimeters per side. KUbeSat-1 is a three-unit satellite launched under the NASA CubeSat Launch Initiative program that offers educational institutions and nonprofit organizations a chance to share space on its rockets. KU\u2019s CubeSat will use a new method to measure the energy and type of primary cosmic rays hitting the Earth, which is traditionally done on Earth. The second payload, the High-Altitude Calibration Instrument Version X will measure very high frequency signals generated by cosmic interactions within the atmosphere. The anticipated lifetime in orbit is 1-2 years, with realistic expectations closer to one year. Data from the mission will be used for academic research and development for more advanced payloads in the future. The initial proposal to build the program from the ground up was submitted in 2018 and approved in 2019. \u201cThe primary goal of KUbeSat-1 has been to allow students at KU to work on an engineering project that has the same stakes as projects in the aerospace industry,\u201d said Brody Gatza, graduate research assistant and project manager. \u201cThe project has encompassed all facets of engineering and has given our team experience working with NASA, leading aerospace companies and regulating agencies.\u201d This isn\u2019t KU\u2019s first try at getting a satellite in orbit. Students made a CubeSat attempt in 2006 wherein the launch vehicle failed, and initial scheduled launches for this satellite began in 2022. NASA\u2019s CubeSat Launch Initiative\u00a0is an ongoing partnership between the agency, educational institutions and nonprofits, providing a path to space for educational\u00a0small satellite\u00a0missions.

Suzanne Shontz KU\u2019s Suzanne Shontz, whose expertise is in parallel scientific computing with a focus on mesh generation and numerical partial differential equations (PDEs), will join principal investigator Cristian Linte, a biomedical image computing expert with the Rochester Institute for Technology, and partners to provide an understanding of the physiological mechanisms that govern heat transfer into biological tissues. This understanding, according to the researchers, is essential to advancing research in developing less invasive treatment options than cardiac ablations, which convert abnormal heart tissue to scar tissue, so that abnormal heart electrical signal pathways are interrupted. With as many as 50% of ablation patients experiencing reoccurrence of cardiac arrhythmias, the development of noninvasive methods to resolve the abnormal cardiac electrical signals promise to reduce these numbers. Although the project focuses on providing a solution to a particular problem, the methods and products developed to do so are expected to have broader applications. For instance, a better understanding of the physiological mechanisms that govern the transfer of heat into biological tissues by modeling and quantifying tissue responses to thermal energy could potentially lead to future tools to better guide and monitor cardiac ablation therapy. \u201cIn fact, on the PDE solver side, uses could be even more expansive than for just medical purposes,\u201d Shontz said. \u201cDiscoveries in heat transfer technology could be applied to mechanical or aerospace applications, for example.\u201d Joining Linte and Shontz on the NSF Computational and Data-enabled Science and Engineering Grant is RIT mechanical engineer Satish Kandlikar. In addition to the institutional support provided by I2S and RIT, the group also will work with cardiologists at the University of Rochester Medical Center and an ablation modeling expert at Medical University of South Carolina. The project will also feature educational and outreach initiatives to train the next generation of scholars and researchers. Shontz, who is also KU\u2019s center director for the Mathematical Methods and Interdisciplinary Computing Center and the engineering school\u2019s associate dean for research and graduate programs, will incorporate the mesh generation concepts and rapid PDE solvers into her parallel scientific computing course.\u00a0Plans also include workshops to engage K-12 students on computational bioengineering topics and a summer camp to attract a diverse group of students, along with a one-day WE\u2019re in Motion event for incoming female engineering students.

    "text": "Jayhawk Astronaut Connects With KU Students From Space Wed, 04/24/2024 author Mark Fagan Share Share by Email Share on LinkedIn Share on Facebook Share on Twitter Loral O\u2019Hara was more than happy to welcome dozens of Jayhawks into the 13,696-square-feet complex where she lives and works. And given the conditions \u2014 speeding through space at 17,500 mph, 248 miles above the Earth \u2014 the astronaut\u2019s inquisitive greeting could have just as easily been received as a real-world engineering challenge. \u201cGood afternoon, University of Kansas,\u201d O\u2019Hara says with a smile, from inside the International Space Station. \u201cHow do you hear me?\u201d Her query would be answered with cheers of affirmation from students and faculty from the School of Engineering, assembled in Woodruff Auditorium at the Kansas Union to hear insights, observations and encouragement from one of the University of Kansas\u2019 most high-flying alumni. O\u2019Hara is the fourth Jayhawk to travel into space, following Joe Engle, Ron Evans and Steven Hawley decades earlier. She earned her bachelor\u2019s degree in aerospace engineering in 2005, started her six-month stay on the ISS in September 2023, and welcomed all the support looking up her way during what would be a 25-minute Q&A on Feb. 9. \u201cI\u2019m so excited,\u201d she said. \u201cAnd it\u2019s great to see you.\u201d \u201cWe miss you here in Lawrence,\u201d said Rick Hale, chair of aerospace engineering, who started the questions by asking how his former student had realized her vision of becoming an astronaut. The quest started with the long-term goal of becoming an astronaut, O\u2019Hara said, which helped guide the many decisions \u2014 such as pursuing degrees and conducting research \u2014 that would make a difference: \u201cIt\u2019s all of these little things that you do along the way and all the things that you learn along the way that really help build up who you become and what you\u2019re able to do.\u201d Lauren Brinsfield, a sophomore in aerospace engineering, asked about the testing O\u2019Hara experienced in the astronaut program. O\u2019Hara said it starts as a \u201cstandardized flow\u201d akin to Astronaut 101 but then is supplemented with critical specifics once a mission is assigned: payload particulars, medical training, and more. \u201cEach of those flows usually has some kind of exam, or just a \u2018knowledge gate,\u2019 we call them, afterward,\u201d O\u2019Hara said. Then there\u2019s training specific to the Soyuz launch vehicle, which was all conducted in Russia. Reanne Reida, a senior in aerospace engineering, was curious about how training for weightlessness is different from, well, the weightlessness of space. O\u2019Hara said she initially found herself fighting microgravity, but soon came to embrace the new normal, even using it to her advantage: \u201cSo now, if I let go of something and it\u2019s drifting away from me, I can kind of look at it and judge if it\u2019s just going to hit the wall and come back. And I don\u2019t have to move to go pick it up.\u201d And while her memories of microgravity flights while a student at KU remain vivid \u2014 using a single finger to push off the floor of a plane to float, even for only a few moments, \u201cwas just the coolest feeling,\u201d she said \u2014 she now takes such sensations in stride. \u201cIt\u2019s, maybe, like dipping your hand in the ocean versus jumping in the ocean,\u201d she said with a chuckle, effortlessly flipping to sit on the ISS ceiling. \u201cIt\u2019s pretty amazing being in extended microgravity.\u201d Other differences in space: Simple sounds on Earth \u2014 falling rain and snow, a splash in the ocean, a breeze in the trees \u2014 are noticeably absent, and much missed: \u201cUp here, we just hear machine noise all the time.\u201d A cargo shipment \u2014 sending up food including blueberries, apples, peppers, grapefruit and oranges \u2014 can bring a welcome awakening of the senses: \u201cThe smell just explodes out of the box.\u201d But the regular morning coffee isn\u2019t the same: \u201cYou can\u2019t smell it, because it\u2019s in a bag with a straw. It\u2019ll be nice to have a cup of coffee that you can actually smell.\u201d Going for a walk takes practice: \u201cAs astronauts \u2026 nobody comes in with spacewalk training. We learn that from scratch. So that has represented seven years of training on the ground. And getting to put all that together and actually go out the door and do a spacewalk was just a peak life experience.\u201d But even amid walking in space and accepting cargo and conducting research and troubleshooting equipment and everything else that keeps the ISS \u2014 \u201cthis incredible thing that humans built,\u201d O\u2019Hara says \u2014 orbiting the Earth, there are still opportunities to stay grounded. \u201cWe actually have pretty good connectivity,\u201d she said. \u201cWe have brief periods of time when we don\u2019t have comm or, basically, Wi-Fi connection, but we\u2019re able to stream music and download books onto our tablet, so that\u2019s what I like to do up here.\u201d O\u2019Hara also has picked up what she calls \u201clittle life skills\u201d in space, including mindfulness, that she hopes to both retain herself and share with others. In particular are the importance of good communication and relationships, she said, and to always strive to improve skills in those areas: \u201cTough times build relationships, but good relationships can also avert tough times.\u201d Seeing Earth against the blackness of space, she said, has reinforced her appreciation for the planet\u2019s beauty, complexity and diversity. \u201cIt really gives me a sense of urgency to come back down to Earth and play a part in making it better,\u201d she said, \u201cand I would just love for everybody to get to enjoy that view and recognize what a special place we have to call home.\u201d During the Q&A, aerospace engineering students saw an astronaut sporting a uniform with familiar colors \u2013 crimson short-sleeved shirt, blue utility pants \u2013 and spinning a weightless Jayhawk doll that she had brought aboard.

    "text": "KU Engineering to honor 2 alumni with Distinguished Engineering Service Award Mon, 04/22/2024 author Cody Howard Share Share by Email Share on LinkedIn Share on Facebook Share on Twitter LAWRENCE \u2014 University of Kansas School of Engineering alumni Zack Holland and Brian McClendon will receive the school\u2019s highest award in a ceremony set for 6 p.m. May 2. The Distinguished Engineering Service Award (DESA) is given each year to individuals who have maintained close association with the school and have made outstanding contributions to the engineering profession and to society. \u201cBeyond their groundbreaking achievements in their respective fields, this year winners each have a track record of remarkable service and generosity to the School of Engineering,\u201d said Dean of Engineering Mary Rezac. \u201cWe are honored to recognize their accomplishments and grateful for their continuing support.\u201d The School of Engineering Advisory Board has given the Distinguished Engineering Service Award annually since 1980. The award is made on the basis of an individual\u2019s contribution to the public good, governmental service or the educational system, or contributions to the theories and practices of engineering, research and development in new fields of engineering or direction of an organization that has made exceptional contributions in design, production and development. About the honorees: Zack Holland Over the course of his professional journey in the oil and gas industry, Zack Holland has made significant contributions at multiple companies in Kansas and Oklahoma. In addition, his good humor and conscientious engagement make him a model advocate and champion for all things KU. Zack Holland Holland earned his bachelor\u2019s degree in petroleum engineering from KU in 1996 and later received a master\u2019s in business administration from Oklahoma State University. After earning his degree from KU, he spent the next 17 years as an engineer for five different oil and gas companies (Anadarko, Samson, Dominion, Chesapeake Energy and Devon Energy). Because of his ability to work with diverse groups, he was consistently given higher levels of responsibility \u2014 leading teams of geologists, geophysicists, production engineers, landmen, drilling engineers and regulatory personnel. With that experience as a foundation, in 2013, he left private employment to become a co-founder of Felix Energy, a private-equity backed startup venture in the oil and gas industry headquartered in Denver. He served as vice president for engineering for the new company and was involved in staffing and project acquisition. Under Holland\u2019s direction, Felix Energy identified its first significant project in 2013 in the Anadarko Basin, targeting stacked reservoirs using two-mile horizontal laterals coupled with large, hydraulic fracture treatments. The culmination of that project was a sale to his former employer, Devon Energy, for $2.5 billion in 2015. Immediately recapitalizing, Felix Energy was on the hunt for another project and landed in the Delaware Basin in West Texas, where once again, utilizing similar technologies, it cracked the code in the Wolfcamp formation. That project was sold to WPX Energy for $2.5 billion in 2020. After Felix came to an end\u00a0in 2022, Holland traveled with his family and also became an angel investor in a few small projects in areas of interest to him, including agriculture and finance. In 2023, Holland founded Batavia Energy to invest in a startup founded by another KU petroleum engineer, Daniel Ott, focusing on mining bitcoin. That project has been operational since late 2023 and remains active today. Beyond his career in industry, Holland has demonstrated passion for his alma mater. In 2021, he provided $600,000 to elevate a previously established fellowship in Professor Emeritus Don Green\u2019s name that was initiated and funded mainly by former students. With Holland\u2019s support, that fellowship is now the Don W. Green Chemical & Petroleum Engineering Professorship, which is awarded to a faculty member in promotion of excellence in teaching. The fund is also used to support undergraduate research, teaching fellowships and graduate student fellowships. Holland shared his insight on the needs and direction of the petroleum engineering profession through his service on the advisory board for Department of Chemical & Petroleum Engineering from 2006 to 2010, coinciding with a period of growth for the department. Additional faculty were coming on board, and planning was under way for new buildings (Ritchie and Slawson halls) which came to fruition in 2018. Beyond the engineering school, Holland\u2019s philanthropic contributions to the university are significant. He received a music scholarship as a student, was a member of the KU University Band, and he remains a passionate supporter of the School of Music. He established a scholarship to honor the memory of Thomas Stidham, professor emeritus of music, who directed the KU University Band when Holland was a student. He has also supported KU Music students by sponsoring international travel opportunities and partnering with the school in its exchange relationship with the Giuseppe Verdi Conservatory of Music in Milan. In addition to his aforementioned support of the schools of Engineering and Music, Holland provided a $1 million gift to the KU Alumni Association. His support was critical in getting the new Jayhawk Welcome Center off the ground and into reality. He also established the Terry Wilson leadership award at KU\u2019s Sigma Alpha Epsilon fraternity, and in his hometown of Sublette, he established a scholarship program in honor of his high school math teacher, Richard Duncan, for graduates pursuing STEM-related programs. Holland resides in Denver with his wife, Melissa, an Emporia State graduate. They have been married for 25 years and have three daughters \u2013 Meghan (college graduate, working in Denver), Zoe (attending college in Chicago) and Reese (a high school senior and future Jayhawk). Brian McClendon Brian McClendon has changed the way we view and interact with geographic information. As co-creator of Google Earth, he made Lawrence the literal center of the digital globe. Brian McClendon He is dedicated to excellence in engineering and to innovation in technology. He has been a lifelong friend to KU and the School of Engineering, generously giving his time, talent and support to many KU programs over the years. McClendon earned his bachelor\u2019s degree in electrical engineering in 1986. He then spent eight years at Silicon Graphics developing high-end 3D graphics workstations, laying a foundation for his later achievements. In 2001, he co-founded Keyhole, where he co-developed the Keyhole Earth Viewer and Keyhole Markup Language (KML) \u2014 an XML schema for expressing geographic information. This became an open standard for GIS data in 2008, and 13 of McClendon\u2019s 41 patents are related to KML. Keyhole was later acquired by Google and released as Google Earth, revolutionizing how we interact with geospatial data. McClendon led Google\u2019s geospatial division for 10 years, driving the development of Google Maps, Street View, Google Earth and Google Earth Engine \u2014 a program allowing researchers to detect deforestation, classify land cover and estimate forest biomass and carbon. His commitment to innovation continued at Uber, where he served for two years as vice president of mapping. It continues now at Niantic, where he leads engineering in mapping and augmented reality. For 30 years, he has advised and invested in hundreds of technology founders, helping them on their own journey to innovation. In addition to his trailblazing career, McClendon has shown a remarkable commitment to his alma mater. He has funded graduate and undergraduate engineering scholarships, the LEEP2 atrium bears his name, and he has given substantial support to the Department of Electrical Engineering & Computer Science faculty retention fund. He served on advisory boards for the engineering school and EECS. As a research professor in the EECS department, McClendon hosted open office hours and taught Startup School, a six-week course to help technology founders realize their vision. He has provided assistance, access, inspiration and support to future engineers by giving talks to students at all levels of education. McClendon\u2019s career achievements have earned him national and international recognition. He was given the United Nations Champions of the Earth Award in 2013. He was elected to the National Academy of Engineering in 2015 and the National Academy of Inventors in 2023, and he received an honorary doctorate from KU in 2016. In addition, Google Earth is now displayed at the Smithsonian Institution in Washington, D.C., and the British Science Museum in London.

Amy Hansen and Admin Husic, who are each assistant professors in the Department of Civil, Environmental & Architectural Engineering, each received National Science Foundation Career Development (CAREER) awards. Research for both professors focuses on water quality and water resources. \u201cThese awards expand the KU School of Engineering\u2019s research capabilities in an area critical to a sustainable future,\u201d said Dean of Engineering Mary Rezac. \u201cThis early-career recognition also showcases the excellence of KU Engineering faculty.\u201d About the Research Amy Hansen Assistant Professor of Civil, Environmental and Architectural Engineering Amy Hansen\u2019s research focuses on the ability of wetlands to improve water quality by removing nitrate. She received a five-year, $577,000 grant from the National Science Foundation Early Career Development (CAREER) award for work to understand the role of vegetation in nitrogen exchange and removal in riparian wetlands. Hansen wants to clarify the conditions under which wetlands and floodplains can have a positive effect on water quality, especially when fast-moving rivers are sending nitrogen- and sediment-laden flows into the riparian acreages. The wetlands, filled with vegetation, allow such flows to slow significantly and even to pool, thus changing the chemistry of the local environment. During periods of heavy rain, nitrogen from fertilizers runs from farm fields into streams and rivers. Such nitrate then can harm the local ecosystem and challenge the quality of water supplies. Hansen\u2019s previous research has shown that riparian wetlands can help improve water quality significantly. With the CAREER grant, she wants to document and specify the conditions under which such improvements are delivered, so that the information can help guide wetlands construction and management. \u201c This project responds to a scientific and societal need to generalize our understanding of the potential for riparian wetlands\u00a0 to mitigate impaired water quality under the expanding local, national and global footprint of agriculture,\u201d Hansen said. CAREER awards are considered among the NSF\u2019s most prestigious. The awards are given annually to about 500 early-career faculty who have the potential to serve as academic role models in both research and education. NSF expects recipients\u2019 activities to build a firm foundation for a lifetime of leadership in integrating education and research. Hansen, who joined the KU faculty in 2018, plans for the research to extend into learning, both on campus and in the field. She plans to engage KU students in the work through experiential learning in classes such as CE 756: Wetland Hydrology, and to generate community engagement through collaboration with\u00a0 Baker Wetlands at the southern edge of Lawrence. Her team will gather observational data, detailing how much and how fast water flows into wetlands, and how long it remains. Field experiments on wetland vegetation will measure the effect of water velocity and vegetation on rates of nitrogen transformation. Mathematical models then will be created to explain whether local-scale interactions can explain larger patterns in nitrogen removal. The goal is to gain new information, change education and outreach and, ultimately, make a difference in water quality. \u201cMy research has sparked a lot of interest from people who are invested in improving water quality and quantifying the ecosystem services that wetlands could provide,\u201d Hansen said. \u201cI hope that this new study transforms our understanding of how riparian wetlands can contribute to nitrate removal and informs new approaches that\u00a0 incorporate wetlands into water resource management and planning\u00a0 in agricultural landscapes.\u201d Admin Husic Assistant Professor of Civil, Environmental and Architectural Engineering Admin Husic\u2019s research examines how humans have and will affect natural water systems. He was awarded a five-year, $609,000 grant from the National Science Foundation Early Career Development (CAREER) award for his efforts to document and share what he describes as \u201cdynamic connectivity: a research and educational frontier for sustainable environmental management under climate and land use uncertainty.\u201d Husic is working to understand how landscapes adjust as they direct water \u2014 and the sediment and nutrients that it carries \u2014 to rivers. If efforts to manage shared water resources are to be successful, he said, it will be critical to understand the role that humans play in affecting such timeless connections. He sees two questions driving the work: \u2018How have humans changed the landscapes around us for the worse, and how are we able to manage them for the better?\u201d \u201cWater is such a basic necessity \u2014 not just for humans but for all living things on Earth,\u201d Husic said. \u201cHowever, in many places throughout the world, water is often lacking \u2014 either in its quantity or quality. I\u2019m motivated by a desire to ensure its availability and safety for people.\u201d CAREER awards are considered among the NSF\u2019s most prestigious, given annually to about 500 early-career faculty with the potential to serve as academic role models in research and education. NSF expects recipients\u2019 activities to build a firm foundation for a lifetime of leadership in integrating education and research. Husic\u2019s work aims to bring a new, dynamic approach to traditionally qualitative, static assessments of the connectivity of hydrologic systems throughout the United States. His team will look back in time and leverage high-frequency aquatic sensors for nitrate and turbidity in more than 150 rivers, using the data to train a deep learning model. Dynamic connectivity will be expressed through mathematics, revealing dominant pathways of connection. Machine learning will link how attributes of the landscape affect river quality, and a web application will help determine the potential for using dynamic connectivity as a management tool. \u201cThis work will provide us with a set of predictive tools that will indicate where, when and how water quality is deteriorated,\u201d Husic said, noting that the work will attempt to answer a number of critical questions. Among them: \u201cCan dynamic landscape connectivity be strategically managed to confer ecosystem benefits while maintaining societal demands?\u201d Husic, who joined the KU faculty in 2018, leads a research lab of undergraduate and graduate students developing models and systems that can be used train the next generation of engineers and policymakers \u201cto be good stewards,\u201d he said, of humanity\u2019s shared and changing human-environment systems. \u201cThe CAREER award will act as a springboard for achieving our lab\u2019s goals and will set us up for success \u2014 not only in the next five years, but for the decades to come as land use and climate change intensify and bring new water challenges,\u201d Husic said.

Admin Husic is the recipient of an NSF Early Career Development (CAREER) award for his efforts to document and share what he describes as \u201cdynamic connectivity: a research and educational frontier for sustainable environmental management under climate and land use uncertainty.\u201d Husic is working to understand how landscapes adjust as they direct water \u2014 and the sediment and nutrients that it carries \u2014 to rivers. If efforts to manage shared water resources are to be successful, he said, it will be critical to understand the role that humans play in affecting such timeless connections. He sees two questions driving the work: \u2018How have humans changed the landscapes around us for the worse, and how are we able to manage them for the better?\u201d \u201cWater is such a basic necessity \u2014 not just for humans but for all living things on Earth,\u201d Husic said. \u201cHowever, in many places throughout the world, water is often lacking \u2014 either in its quantity or quality. I\u2019m motivated by a desire to ensure its availability and safety for people.\u201d CAREER awards are considered among the NSF\u2019s most prestigious, given annually to about 500 early-career faculty with the potential to serve as academic role models in research and education. NSF expects recipients\u2019 activities to build a firm foundation for a lifetime of leadership in integrating education and research. Husic\u2019s work aims to bring a new, dynamic approach to traditionally qualitative, static assessments of the connectivity of hydrologic systems throughout the United States. His team will look back in time and leverage high-frequency aquatic sensors for nitrate and turbidity in more than 150 rivers, using the data to train a deep learning model. Dynamic connectivity will be expressed through mathematics, revealing dominant pathways of connection. Machine learning will link how attributes of the landscape affect river quality, and a web application will help determine the potential for using dynamic connectivity as a management tool. \u201cThis work will provide us with a set of predictive tools that will indicate where, when and how water quality is deteriorated,\u201d Husic said, noting that the work will attempt to answer a number of critical questions. Among them: \u201cCan dynamic landscape connectivity be strategically managed to confer ecosystem benefits while maintaining societal demands?\u201d Husic, who joined the KU faculty in 2018, leads a research lab of undergraduate and graduate students developing models and systems that can be used train the next generation of engineers and policymakers \u201cto be good stewards,\u201d he said, of humanity\u2019s shared and changing human-environment systems. \u201cThe CAREER award will act as a springboard for achieving our lab\u2019s goals and will set us up for success \u2014 not only in the next five years, but for the decades to come as land use and climate change intensify and bring new water challenges,\u201d Husic said.

Wed, 02/21/2024 author Erinn Barcomb-Peterson Share Share by Email Share on LinkedIn Share on Facebook Share on Twitter LAWRENCE \u2014 Elizabeth Appel looks at her future in engineering as more than just capitalizing on a talent for math and science. For Appel, it\u2019s also a way to benefit humanity using a discipline that is not necessarily people-focused. \u201cI think one major issue is a lack of education on infrastructure not just as a technical product, but also as a social tool,\u201d Appel said. \u201cThe built environment shapes how people interact with one another and how they see themselves in their greater community. Public services and public spaces have great power to influence peoples\u2019 lives for the better.\u201d Appel is a 2020 Park Hill High School graduate and a University of Kansas senior in civil engineering with an emphasis in environmental engineering. She is also the most recent Jayhawk to be named a Gates Cambridge scholar , bringing the university\u2019s total number of winners to four since the program was established. The scholarship covers the full cost of studying at the University of Cambridge in the United Kingdom. Gates Cambridge scholars are chosen for their outstanding intellectual ability, leadership potential, a commitment to improving the lives of others and reasons for their choice of course. For Appel, that will be pursuing a Master of Philosophy degree in Engineering for Sustainable Development. \u201cI felt there was a gap in my understanding of how to engineer things not just for today's problems, but for tomorrow's problems as well,\u201d Appel said. \u201cThat's the main reason I pursued this Master of Philosophy program.\u201d In her application, Appel noted how this particular program will facilitate her goal of becoming an engineer striving to undo the damage done by decades of divisive infrastructure. Internships and experiences as a KU undergraduate exposed Appel to the societal impact of infrastructure in the region, from the South Lawrence Trafficway to urban Kansas City communities shaped and dominated by highways. \u201cI've always known you learn more from people than you do in a classroom,\u201d Appel said.\u00a0\u201cWorking with engineers, students and community advocates in the Kansas City metro has really solidified my belief in the power of engineers to do real good for the communities.\u201d As a KU undergraduate, Appel has pursued research that explores \u201cambiguous, social-focused questions\u201d related to civil engineering. Working with Admin Husic, assistant professor of civil engineering, Appel examined the correlation between \"redlined\" neighborhoods as defined in the 1930s-1950s and modern urban flooding in those areas. \u201cElizabeth is investigating the intersection of flooding and social vulnerability,\u201d Husic said. \u201cHer aim is to understand how flooding may disproportionately impact certain groups and what engineers and policymakers should do to address that inequity.\u201d Appel\u2019s many leadership roles at KU have included restarting the university\u2019s competitive design-build competition Concrete Canoe and leading the team to a third-place finish in the regional competition in 2023. At the 2022 regional competition, KU could only bring three people and no competitive teams. \u201cI was motivated by my urge to represent KU well on a regional level and to provide the same opportunities that other students had to my own peers,\u201d she said.\u00a0\u201cRestarting Concrete Canoe was a lot of work, but it showed that even a team of novices can outperform established competitors. That experience taught me that even without technical expertise or experience in the subject, if one has the persistence and dedication necessary to push forward, anything is possible.\u201d The Gates Cambridge Scholarship program was established in 2000 by $210 million from the Bill and Melinda Gates Foundation to the University of Cambridge. The first class of scholars came into residence in October 2001. Since then, the trust has awarded more than 2,000 scholarships to scholars from more than 100 countries. Each year Gates Cambridge offers full-cost scholarships to outstanding applicants from countries outside the United Kingdom to pursue a postgraduate degree in any subject available at the University of Cambridge. Approximately 25 awards are available in the U.S. each year. Around the world is a community of more than 1,700 Gates Cambridge alumni, including three Jayhawks.

Fri, 02/09/2024 author Michelle Keller Share Share by Email Share on LinkedIn Share on Facebook Share on Twitter LAWRENCE \u2014 The University of Kansas\u2019 Institute for Sustainable Engineering has a new name \u2014 Wonderful Institute for Sustainable Engineering-KU (WISE-KU). The naming builds on the university\u2019s deep relationship with The Wonderful Company, a global agricultural company co-founded and led by Stewart and Lynda Resnick. The Wonderful Company is one of the largest privately held companies in the U.S. whose iconic brands include Wonderful Pistachios, POM Wonderful, FIJI Water, JUSTIN Wines and others. Along with the rebranding comes a $5 million commitment to promote sustainable engineering initiatives. \u201cComplex problems require new and novel approaches in order to arrive at workable solutions,\u201d said KU Chancellor Douglas A. Girod. \u201cThe Resnicks are prime examples of how creative use of philanthropy can drive university research and discoveries. We\u2019re grateful they\u2019ve chosen to work with our talented faculty and students to solve some of today\u2019s thorniest issues. Their investment, combined with the opportunity to work on real-world challenges, will benefit generations to come.\u201d The Resnicks have a long history of supporting leading research universities in driving research solutions to solve the world\u2019s most critical environmental challenges across energy, water, food and the climate.

    "text": "Engineering professor receives DARPA grant for research on radar signal processing Mon, 01/08/2024 author Cody Howard Share Share by Email Share on LinkedIn Share on Facebook Share on Twitter LAWRENCE \u2014 A faculty member in the University of Kansas Department of Electrical Engineering & Computer Science recently received a prestigious grant from the Defense Advanced Research Projects Agency (DARPA) to research more effective ways of using the radar spectrum. The two-year, $500,000 grant was awarded to Patrick McCormick, who holds a joint appointment as assistant professor in the EECS department and as assistant scientist at the KU Institute for Information Sciences (I2S). The electromagnetic spectrum is a highly desired resource for wireless radio frequency technologies, and the traditional means for allocation of users is becoming increasingly impracticable in recent years. McCormick\u2019s research largely focuses on radar signal processing, specifically the problem of spectral congestion. The term \u201cspectral congestion\u201d would seem to imply that the spectrum is full, but according to McCormick, it is \u201chighly underutilized,\u201d and we aren\u2019t using it efficiently. \u201cThe electromagnetic spectrum on average is largely vacant of signals, which has prompted the U.S. government to promote sharing of the spectrum to bolster the economy via spectral auctions. This trend will no doubt continue. Therefore, unintended spectral interference will be commonplace for both radar and communication systems in the future,\u201d McCormick said. Promoting the sharing of spectrum will improve spectral usage but will likely result in competing signals interfering with one another, thus decreasing the efficiency of the usage. According to McCormick, the solution to this problem lies in the design of the signal processing. \u201cWe\u2019re going to have to be a lot more robust in how we design our processing. Our radar signal processing methods today are largely built upon the assumption of an interference-free environment,\u201d McCormick said. McCormick\u2019s research explores designing signal processing algorithms that limit signal interference. \u201cI\u2019m proposing a framework that allows radar to operate within a certain band, monitor the band and separate out the desired signals from the ones I don\u2019t care about,\u201d McCormick said. Designing robust signal processing techniques enables the sharing of spectral bands while mitigating the issue of unintended interference. \u201cI hope the results from this project will be a seed for a research portfolio that continues to expand in the future,\u201d McCormick said.

In order to determine this, we feel that visiting our campus in Lawrence and the Medical Center campus in Kansas City is a very important step. In order to facilitate your visit to KU, there are two main options: The first, and most preferred, option entails simply applying for Fall admission to the program. If you are admitted, it is highly likely that you will be invited to participate in BIOE Sneak Peek in late February prior to the Fall semester of your intended matriculation. A portion of the costs for your travel, accommodations and meals will be reimbursed to you if you participate in Visitation Days.

Is the TOEFL required for all international students applying for admissions into your Graduate program? Click to expand The Test of English as a Foreign Language (TOEFL) is required for any applicant who indicates that English is not their native language. Additionally, the Test of Spoken English (TSE) may be required. Please see KU English Proficiency Requirements for more details. What are Student/Advisor Expectations Click to expand Student/Advisor Expectations \u2013 A basis to build upon\u2026 The information below should be used as general guidelines in the student/advisor relationship. These are not rules that are set in stone but a platform to build on. Every advisor and lab situation is different so expectations should be discussed and clearly laid out by both parties prior to the \u201ctrack and advisor declaration form\u201d being signed. Things to consider\u2026 Research What general area of research is a particular advisor working on and what specific projects are currently being conducted? Is this general area something you are interested in working on for the next few years? Projects are continually evolving. You may not be working on the same project that is currently being conducted. This is often correlated with the aims of grant funding. Have a plan if you are unable to work with your \u201cfirst choice\u201d advisor or project. Be open-minded about what type of research you might do. You could find a project or area you really love that is completely different than what you thought you wanted to do. Peer review and research validation is important. MS students should expect to submit at least one published manuscript and PhD students should submit at least three; though you should discuss individual expectations with your advisor. Know and adhere to all guidelines for intellectual property. When in doubt, ask your advisor. Cohesiveness Find out how much supervision and direction the advisor will give you and in what manner they conduct it. Establish open, effective and straightforward communication with your advisor and other lab personnel. Spend a few weeks in the lab of any prospective advisor before making any decisions. Make sure that the research area and functional dynamics are a good fit. Request to attend group meetings within the lab. Other students in the lab can provide good insight into the project, advisor and expectations. A good relationship with other students is beneficial to your success. Try multiple labs before making a decision. You may be surprised how well you fit into a lab OR research area OR track that you didn\u2019t expect to like. Time Commitments GRA/GTA agreements are typically set at 40-50%. This does NOT mean that you should expect to be in the \u201coffice\u201d for 20 hours per week and you\u2019re done. You should consider your thesis to be above and beyond your GRA/GTA work requirements. An advisor will generally expect you to hold regular hours like a job. Generally between 8-5, you should be working in class, lab, office, etc. Academic breaks are a great opportunity to catch up on research An advisor will expect you to make regular forward progress on your research (even if it is negative results, it\u2019s still progress) The time it takes you to do this will vary. GRA research will develop your knowledge and experience. This should be kept in mind when \u201ccounting the hours you work.\u201d The more work you put in, the more you get out. Outside jobs (on or off campus) are generally frowned upon. If it is necessary, discuss it with your advisor BEFORE you take another job. Funding It\u2019s important\u2026but not everything! It\u2019s in your best interest to find an advisor that has funding to support you. If funds are temporarily not available as a GRA, GTA\u2019s are sometimes available to bridge the gap between a PI\u2019s grants. These should NOT be counted on as a guarantee. Students with a GTA need to consider the time demands by that appointment and the impact that will have on your research ability. You will still be expected to be engaged and productive on your research project. Multiple GTA appointments throughout your career can impede research effectiveness and your graduation timeline. Actively participate in the grant seeking, writing and application process. It is vital to the success of your lab and is extremely beneficial experience for you to have. Funding is tied to a project that has specific aims and deadlines. If you accept funding, you agree to apply your time and efforts to that project. Renewal of financial aid is not automatic. It is contingent upon factors such as availability of funding, satisfactory performance, good academic standing and adequate research progress. Be proactive about your funding. Do some work and find out what options are available to you (ie..NIH, NSF, specific research foundations, etc). Do not expect for your advisor or BIOE administration to keep track of your funding for you. Know when your current funding will end and initiate new funding with enough notice to meet deadlines. General Tips A GRA is \u201ca real job.\u201d Your responsibility is to your advisor and the ongoing research for which he/she is responsible. A GRA does NOT get paid to simply write their thesis or do homework. Even if you are funded through an outside source (SELF, NIH, NSF, etc) you are still responsible for conducting research pertinent to the lab\u2019s goal. Work independently with guidance to solve open-ended problems. Don\u2019t get discouraged when things don\u2019t work the way you expected. If you knew what was going to happen, it wouldn\u2019t be research. Collaborate with your advisor and peers, get creative and try something else. When you graduate and get a job, YOU will be the expert people will turn to for answers. Be able to overcome obstacles in research. It\u2019s good practice to analyze data and make sure it is reasonable as you collect it\u2026.NOT after you\u2019ve conducted all of your experiments or when you are ready to write your thesis. There are some great research opportunities at the medical center and off campus. These come with some additional challenges. It is advisable you discuss these with the program assistant and other students. Your advisor\u2019s time is extremely valuable. Consider the value of their time and input and utilize it like you would if you were paying them a consulting fee. Questions you should consider asking a prospective advisor\u2026 Do they have specific hours they want to see you in the lab? Is it applicable to do work outside of the lab? Are you allowed to take time off? (vacation, holidays, spring break, summer, etc) How long? Will your project require intervention from others if you\u2019re gone (cultures, etc)? How do they assess your progress? Do you have to initiate contact? Do they have weekly meetings? What should you do if you\u2019re struggling? How is coursework prioritized? What courses should you be taking and how does it apply to both your lab project and thesis? Do they like you to take all courses upfront? Will you be heavily involved in research immediately and taking a light course load every semester? How will this affect your academic timeline? (ie\u2026Qualifying Exam) Can they fund you? Duration and/or terms of agreement? How much? Is tuition included? Other costs included? (fees, travel to conferences, etc.) How can you help apply for more grants? How many journal submissions are expected? How can you be first author of a publication? Where does that lab typically submit publications? Read some current lab publications What conferences are you expected to attend? Will you be submitting abstracts/posters, etc? Is funding assistance available? What are their expectations of you? This is also a great time to share what you expect from them! What is their policy if you deem it necessary to get another job? Outside employment often conflicts with academic/research progress. How will they help you find a job upon graduation? To what areas will your skills make you marketable? Where do their grads get jobs? What is the average and/or expected time to degree for students in that lab? Is their research primarily modeling/computational or experimental? How would your research project be determined? What are the clinical/market applications of the research? With whom do they collaborate? Engineers, industry, med center, etc??? What courses do they teach? How do you change from M.S. to Ph.D. Click to expand A current BioE M.S. candidate may request that the Graduate Studies Committee change his/her status to a Ph.D. aspirant. Before making the request, the student is required to have competed all general and track deficiencies and a minimum of two semesters (Fall and Spring) as a full time KU BioE graduate student with a minimum 3.5 GPA (graduate courses only). The following is required to be submitted to the Graduate Studies Committee: 1) The student\u2019s letter of intent for his/her Ph.D. program of study 2) The advisor\u2019s letter of evaluation on the student\u2019s level of preparation to begin his/her Ph.D. program of study. The committee\u2019s decision will be based on the student\u2019s letter of intent, the advisor\u2019s letter of evaluation, and the student\u2019s academic performance as a KU BioE graduate student. Generally, a student without an undergraduate degree in an engineering discipline will be required to finish the BioE M.S. degree before pursuing the BioE Ph.D. degree. Exception to this policy must be approved by the Graduate Studies Committee.",

    "text": "Accelerated M.S. Accelerated M.S. What does Bioengineering at KU look like for undergraduates? Click to expand At the University of Kansas, we have three options for undergraduate students interested in Bioengineering and/or Biomedical Engineering: 1. Chemical Engineering with a Biomedical Concentration 2. Mechanical Engineering with a Biomechanics Concentration and 3. 5 year BS Engineering or Computer Science/ MS Bioengineering program The first two of these options allow students to get a degree in one of the traditional engineering disciplines while also exploring bioengineering.\u00a0 The third program allows high achieving students in any engineering discipline or computer science (including those in the Chemical Engineering Biomedical concentration or Mechanical Engineering Biomechanics concentration), to use a fifth year to obtain a master\u2019s degree in Bioengineering on top of an undergraduate degree. About the Program Click to expand Qualified Juniors in the engineering disciplines and computer science at the University of Kansas can apply for an accelerated Master\u2019s in Bioengineering program.\u00a0 Students who are admitted to this program receive academic credit for their exceptional preparation, reducing the time necessary to complete the MS degree. Normally, the MS plan of study requires 24 hours of graduate course credit plus 6 hours of thesis work.\u00a0 Students admitted to the accelerated program receive a 6 credit hour reduction upon admission for 700 level or above course work completed as part of the BS curriculum.\u00a0 This course work should be courses that are required for the MS degree in the bioengineering track of interest within the MS Bioengineering program.\u00a0 Typically this coursework is taken as an advanced engineering elective within the BS curriculum. Application Process Click to expand To take advantage of this accelerated master\u2019s program, undergraduate students at KU would be required to apply to the bioengineering program in the spring semester of their junior year after completing at least 75 credit hours towards their undergraduate degree and at least 15 hours from completion. Graduate applications to start the following summer would open on January 1 and close March 15. The applicants overall GPA and engineering GPA should be at least 3.50 at the time of applying for the program. If accepted, the students must maintain at least a 3.50 for all remaining undergraduate courses in their B.S. program. Students must apply online by the deadline to be considered for this program to ensure an undergraduate course plan is initiated and students are advised appropriately. Application requirements include: Complete Graduate Application (GRE scores are not required for these applicants) Three Letters of Recommendation (one from the student\u2019s identified thesis advisor) A Personal Statement with Proposed Research Topic & Bioengineering Track Focus An Undergraduate Progress Report Form (showing proposed courses up to BS graduation) A Graduate Plan of Study (listing proposed graduate coursework) *Students are required to take all Bioengineering general and track prerequisites as undergraduate electives. This typically means taking a biology and/or chemistry course as a general undergraduate elective (professional elective in EECS, list 2 elective in ME.) Students are highly encouraged to participate in undergraduate research prior to their application in order to identify their research topic and advisor. Students with extenuating circumstances or those who fail to meet the application requirements or deadline, should contact the Bioengineering program. Exceptions will be made on a case by case basis. Student Advising Click to expand This engineering to bioengineering degree option is only available to undergraduate students at KU pursuing an engineering undergraduate degree. Advisors who have students interested in the Bioengineering Accelerated Master\u2019s Program should refer to the Course Plan attached or contact Samantha Foley at samantha.foley@ku.edu or call 785-864-5258. It is important to discuss this option as early as possible, so students do not miss the deadline to apply (in the spring of their junior year). Students will need to be conducting research during the summer and into their senior year and possibly enrolling in extra credit hours (not counted towards their undergraduate BS degree) or co-enrolling as a graduate and undergraduate. \u00a0If co-enrolling is not feasible, other options are available to acquire the necessary classes in the allotted timeframe. Funding Information Click to expand Students should follow all financial aid enrollment and GPA requirements during their undergraduate career. Some instances and sources of financial aid do not allow for co-enrollment and it is the student\u2019s responsibility to contact the necessary resources to make that determination. If this is the case, the student should not enroll in their graduate career until completion of their undergraduate degree in engineering. Their admission can be deferred for up to one year, at which time they should be finished with the undergraduate degree. Once admitted to the Bioengineering Graduate Program, students may apply for funding or financial aid as needed, but the program will not consider these applicants for GTA positions, as their curriculum is accelerated and the work load would be difficult and may prolong their enrollment beyond the one year plan. GRA positions may be available at the discretion of the faculty advisor.",

    "text": "Master of Engineering M.Eng. Bioengineering Degree Requirements Overview Click to expand The University of Kansas (KU) Master of Engineering in Bioengineering degree program is a coursework only master\u2019s degree. It is very similar to the Master of Science in Bioengineering degree at the University of Kansas. The primary difference is the elimination of research, the thesis and the thesis defense. The thesis credit hours are replaced with the same credit hours of coursework. This degree will prepare students to be more effective in their careers in medicine, private commercial firms, and with entrepreneurship in a start-up company. The coursework-only Master of Engineering in Bioengineering degree is an efficient way for baccalaureate graduates to get more in-depth background and credentials in bioengineering prior to seeking employment. The program is rigorous, and places high demands on the student who must demonstrate that they understand interdisciplinary concepts. The Master of Engineering in Bioengineering degree program provides knowledge breadth in engineering and the biological sciences, and knowledge depth in a particular focused area of coursework. Applicants for the Master of Engineering in Bioengineering will have a baccalaureate degree in engineering, biological science, or a related field. Successful applicants will have strong academic credentials and demonstrated potential for advanced study by performance at the baccalaureate level. The completed Master of Engineering in Bioengineering is evidence of an ability to work as an engineer who is capable of advanced analysis and design. The holder of this degree will have completed significant course work to advance their knowledge and abilities in the area of bioengineering. Master of Engineering students will choose an area of focus from the Bioengineering track list to determine their coursework requirements. Bioimaging Computational bioengineering Biomaterials and tissue engineering Biomechanics and neural engineering Biomedical product design and development Biomolecular engineering The individual track requirements can be found on the Bioengineering website .

Degree Requirements Click to expand The Master\u2019s aspirant works with an advisor familiar with their selected track area to develop a formal plan of study. The tracks are focused in major research and educational themes within the Bioengineering Graduate Program; each track has a track director and affiliated faculty. The student selects from among track courses to construct a comprehensive educational program that takes (a) advantage of the student\u2019s background, (b) builds and demonstrates academic skills, and (c) capitalizes on the strengths of the affiliated faculty. This approach follows a structure common to many of the top Bioengineering/Biomedical Engineering graduate programs nationally (Table 1). Students select one of the tracks for their primary exposure to bioengineering concepts.\u00a0 All the tracks have the same required core courses (total 6 credit hours):\u00a0 C&PE 756 Introduction to Biomedical Engineering (3 credit hours), BIOE 800 Colloquium (2 credit hours total), and BIOE 801 Responsible Conduct of Research in Engineering (1 credit hour).\u00a0 The course C&PE 756 Introduction to Biomedical Engineering, permits them to delve into the subject area of their track, but also allows the student to sample the breadth of bioengineering topics across all of the tracks. \u00a0BIOE 800 Colloquium provides some professional development as well as additional exposure to the breadth of applications in bioengineering.\u00a0 While BIOE 801 Responsible Conduct of Research in Engineering, might seem less relevant for a professional coursework-only Master of Engineering degree, the focus on professional engineering ethics is quite applicable and important for individuals in industry, as well. Beyond the core courses, each track has 9 credit hours of required depth courses focused on the track, and an additional 15 credit hours of breadth courses.\u00a0 The detailed requirements of each track, the depth and breadth courses, as well as the Master Breadth Course List are provided as supporting documents.\u00a0 Enrollment in BIOE 899\u00a0Bioengineering - Independent Investigation (research) is not accepted as breadth coursework for the Master of Engineering degree.\u00a0 A Total of 30 credit hours of coursework are required for the Master of Engineering in Bioengineering degree.\u00a0 Because of the varied nature of the tracks, there are some minor variations in core, depth and breadth requirements between the tracks (see detailed requirements of each track at Degree Requirements page).",

    "text": "Bioimaging Director: Xinmai Yang, Ph.D. Bioimaging science is an evolving field of biomedicine and bioengineering that involves the development and application of imaging technologies and computational software tools to answer biological questions in life sciences. This discipline brings together engineers, computer scientists, physicists, biologists, chemists and clinicians engaged in the development of equipment and methodologies for characterizing tissue properties and examining its structure and function through in vivo or ex vivo visualization at multiple resolutions, ranging from molecular and cellular to organ level. The imaging technologies are mainly based on the principles of optics, photonics, magnetic resonance, nuclear medicine, radiation, ultrasonics and spectroscopy. Modern applications of bioimaging include multi-photon imaging, image-guided interventional procedures, surgical planning, oncology treatment planning, endoscopic and laparoscopic surgeries and virtual telemedicine. Image processing and analysis is an important part of bioimaging and allows measurement and quantification of anatomical, physiological and/or clinically meaningful parameters. This track is closely linked to the other tracks of the bioengineering program because of supplying critical supportive data. For example, as part of bioimaging, gene-array imaging and analysis provide data for mining with the techniques used in bioinformatics. As the students in this track are prepared for careers in industry, academia and public service, they are trained in the current bioimaging modalities; fundamentals of physical and mathematical principles and operations, hardware and software, image contrast produced and its interpretation, image quality analysis and measures, quality control tests with phantoms, receiver operating characteristics and target detectability, molecular and cellular contrast agents. Students are exposed to in vivo and ex vivo applications and learn biomarkers specific to individual modality and their utilities. Students use this knowledge to interpret the image contrast for understanding the basic anatomical and physiological relationships in normal and abnormal (e.g. disease) states and for accurate and reproducible clinical diagnosis or visualization.

    "text": "Biomechanics and Neural Engineering Directors: Terence McIff, Ph.D. Biomechanics is the scientific discipline that studies biological systems, such as the human body, using the methods of Mechanical Engineering. The purpose is to create new and innovative approaches, advance fundamental concepts, and apply knowledge to the improvement of the mechanics of biological systems. While biomechanics represents a broad area of research, from the design of dental implants to the understanding of fluid dynamics in the vascular system, the biomechanics research focus at KU is on the human musculoskeletal system. Our mission is to provide a quality graduate research and educational experience with emphasis on understanding and analyzing the mechanics of the human body through experimental measurement, mathematical modeling and computer simulations. This effort includes studies of the mechanics of the whole-body as a system, a group of body parts as a sub-system, and an individual body part as a component. While this program is firmly grounded on the techniques in mechanical engineering, the nature of the research is multidisciplinary. Collaborative research is being fostered among researchers in engineering, mathematics, the sciences and the KU Medical Center.

    "text": "Biomedical Product Design & Development Director: Sara Wilson, Ph.D. Design and development of new medical products requires advanced bioengineering expertise as well as an understanding of clinical applications, business considerations and regulatory aspects of the medical field. Advanced engineering skills must interface with clinical needs and requirements. The Biomedical Product Design and Development Track combines graduate-level research and coursework with practical exposure to these clinical, business and regulatory processes in a professional, collaborative environment. Students use their new understanding of market-driven forces to plan and execute their research with end-driven methods and an understanding of how their research results could be applied to development of a biomedical product. They not only work with their own basic and applied research, but also with other researchers in the KU Bioengineering community. Medical products to be developed can include diagnostic tools, interventional and therapeutic devices, imaging equipment and methods, and biomaterials. This track includes a course in biomedical product development to introduce basic concepts of design, quality system regulations, regulatory aspects and entrepreneurship. Required courses in engineering design methods teach students how to successfully complete applied research. A clinical or industrial preceptorship is required to give students practical exposure to applied biomedical research and development. Students completing this track will be prepared to apply their product-driven education either in industrial research and development, in a regulatory agency, or in academia interfacing with industry.

Current KU students enroll for their courses twice per academic year. Enrollment for the spring term begins in late October; enrollment for the summer and fall terms begins in late March. Students planning to enroll will first need to meet with an academic advisor to have their Engineering Advising Hold (EAH) released. Students are given an enrollment time that comes via email from the Office of the University Registrar each semester. Your enrollment time is based on the number of hours you have completed.\u00a0Enrollment appointments are scheduled on a staggered basis based on your academic level; generally, seniors are first, then juniors, sophomores, and finally freshmen. You have up until the start of the next semester to make changes to your schedule, but remember, classes will fill up quickly. In Enroll & Pay , students can check their Student Services Center to see when their \u201cenrollment appointment\u201d is scheduled. Logon to Enroll & Pay with your KU online ID and password. Click on the Enrollment Dates link below the Student Center menu. This is the time the Registrar allows you to enroll in your classes. You can also access hold information that has been placed on your record. Any holds (advising, parking, library, immunization, etc.) will need to be cleared before you will be permitted to enroll . Typically, enrollment for the upcoming spring semester begins right after Fall Break, and enrollment for upcoming fall courses is right after Spring Break.

Residency requirements are met with enrollment of two semesters, which may include one summer session, spent in resident study at KU. During this period, the student must be involved full time in academic or professional pursuits, which may include an appointment for teaching or research if it is directed specifically toward degree objectives. The student must be enrolled in a minimum of 6 credit hours per semester. Graduate Students must make satisfactory progress towards their degree to be considered in good standing and eligible for funding as a GTA or GRA. To ensure students are making progress towards their degree, you must submit an annual Graduate Student Activity Report (GAR) to your department prior to the fall semester each academic year. A list of master\u2019s degree requirements can be found at Master's Degree Requirements and within the Academic Catalog. Qualifying Exam (Optional per University / Program Specific) \u2013 Tests knowledge & Research Skills (some departments/programs have coursework or area requirements) see list of departmental requirements below. Comprehensive Oral Exam (Required by University / Program Specific) \u2013 Completed after major portion of coursework, research skills, responsible scholarship, and residency completed, see list of departmental requirements below. Student must be in good academic standing with no incomplete grades and have a complete and approved Plan of Study on file (see more details at Doctoral Degree Comprehensive Oral Exams ). Doctoral Candidacy \u2013 After passing the Comprehensive Oral Exam, the candidate must be continuously enrolled, including summer sessions, until all requirements for the degree are completed, and each enrollment must reflect as accurately as possible the candidate\u2019s demands on faculty time and university facilities. During this time, until all requirements for the degree are completed (including filing of the dissertation) OR until 18 post-comprehensive hours have been completed (whichever comes first), the candidate must enroll for a minimum of 6 hours a semester and 3 hours a summer session (see more details at Doctoral Candidacy ). Doctoral Defense - When a graduate student passes the final oral examination or dissertation defense, the student must deliver all graduation requirements to the School of Engineering Research & Graduate Programs Office (1415 LEEP2) so that completion of degree requirements may be officially certified. More information can be found at Doctoral Degree Final Oral Exams . The graduation checklist is available online at Graduate Checklists and graduation deadlines are posted on the KU Graduate Studies webpage at Graduation Calendars & Key Dates (see the annual Academic Calendar under Important Information). Qualifying Exam Definitions: AE - The qualifying examination tests breadth of knowledge and determines the student\u2019s ability to formulate mathematical representations of real physical situations. The examination covers mathematics and 2 of these 5 areas: Aerodynamics Astronautics Structures and materials Dynamics and controls Propulsion BioE - Each doctoral student must pass the doctoral qualifying examination, normally taken at the end of the first year of graduate study. The written and oral examination measures the student\u2019s ability to comprehend and communicate technical literature in the chosen track of study. The qualifying examination may be retaken once. A more detailed description of the examination is available on the program's website . CPE - All doctoral students are required to complete the qualifying exam, also termed the preliminary examination of research, after the completion of their core coursework. Students must maintain a cumulative GPA of at least 3.2 for Chemical Engineers and 3.25 for Petroleum Engineers in the core courses, as specified by the graduate standards committee. After completing the preliminary exam the students is considered a PhD aspirant. Students who complete a master's degree at KU in Chemical & Petroleum Engineering are not required to complete the preliminary exam. CEAE - An aspirant for the Ph.D. degree must pass a qualifying examination. The department normally gives this examination upon completion of the aspirant\u2019s M.S. work or at a comparable level for non-M.S. students. EECS - Each doctoral student must pass a doctoral qualifying examination, which also meets the research skills requirement. This is an assessment of the student\u2019s ability to conduct PhD-level scholarship based on classroom performance, written research and an oral examination to be given by a committee of tenured/tenure track graduate faculty members. ME - Students should plan to complete the qualifying examination in the first semester of participation in the doctoral program on regular status. The doctoral qualifying examination covers basic material from major areas in mechanical engineering and advanced materials from the student\u2019s specialty. On successful completion of the qualifying examination, the student selects a major professor to serve as the chair of their doctoral committee and direct their research. Comprehensive Oral Exam Definitions AE - When the aspirant has completed most of the course work and satisfied the research skills (AE 691), responsible scholarship (AE 692) and residency requirements, he or she must take the comprehensive examination. The comprehensive examination is made up of two parts. The first part must consist of a written research proposal outlining in some detail the work to be done for the dissertation. The second part is an oral examination in which she or he must defend the research plans and demonstrate competence in her or his particular and related areas. Upon passing the comprehensive examination, the aspirant becomes a doctoral candidate. BioE - Doctoral students must take the comprehensive examination after passing the qualifying examination, completing the research skills requirement (BioE 800), residency requirement, responsible scholarship requirement (BioE 801), and at least \u00be of the course work required in the Plan of Study. The examining committee for the comprehensive examination is generally the student\u2019s doctoral advisory committee. Before the examination, the student must submit in writing to the committee a detailed NIH or NSF-style research proposal for a possible Ph.D. dissertation project. Any modifications to the format should be approved by the student\u2019s doctoral advisory committee. The comprehensive examination evaluates the student\u2019s ability to write an original research proposal, design experiments, and interpret results in a sound and critical manner. A more detailed description of the examination is available on the program's website . Passing the examination advances the student to doctoral candidacy. CPE - The aspirant takes the comprehensive examination after completion of a majority of the course work for the Ph.D. and student has met residency, research skills and responsible scholarship requirements (C&PE 800). The examination consists of 2 parts: a written proposal for research and an oral examination based on, but not limited to, the research proposal. For the research proposal, the student is assigned a topic of current interest to the chemical and/or petroleum engineering profession by an examining committee. The aspirant identifies a research problem in the assigned topic area and prepares a written proposal for research on this problem. Normally, the written proposal must be prepared over a specified time period of 30 consecutive days and must be distinctly different from the dissertation problem. The examining committee evaluates the research proposal upon completion. If the committee judges it satisfactory, the oral examination part of the comprehensive examination is held. The oral examination is based on the research proposal but may also cover areas peripheral to the proposal. To prepare the aspirant for the comprehensive examination, the advisory committee may require enrollment in C&PE 902 Preparation for the Ph.D. Comprehensive Examination during the first year of the Ph.D. program. CEAE - Before being admitted to the comprehensive examination, the aspirant must satisfy residency and the department\u2019s basic research skills and responsible scholarship requirements. The research skill requirement provides the aspirant with a research skill distinct from, but strongly supportive of, the dissertation research. Research skills are often met when students complete a research-related course, listed on the approved Plan of Study. The responsible scholarship requirement serves to ensure that students are trained in responsible research and this requirement is met when students complete the Responsible Scholarship Training Seminar (8 \u2013 one hour sessions). All doctoral students must successfully complete the training seminar in their first fall semester of enrollment. EECS - The student must take the doctoral comprehensive examination after passing the qualifying examination, completing the research skills requirement, and completing at least \u00be of the course work requirement beyond the M.S. The student must complete the comprehensive examination before detailed work on the Ph.D. dissertation begins. Before the examination, the student must submit in writing to the committee a detailed proposal for a possible Ph.D. dissertation. In the comprehensive examination, the student is examined upon the proposal and on knowledge and insight in the specialization, and a dissertation committee is formed. ME - The comprehensive examination has a written and oral component. The written component contains a detailed literature review of existing research in the proposed area as well as a description of the work or research plan to be completed for the dissertation. For the oral component, the aspirant must defend the proposed work or research plan and demonstrate proficiency in the specialization.",

    "text": "School of Engineering Graduate Program Timelines Master\u2019s Program, M.S. These are general timelines for degree completion, based on regular admission (no pre-requisites required), full-time enrollment and satisfactory progress. We expect our students to make every effort to complete their degree within three years (average for most programs, including part-time programs). Enrollment in the summer is not required for master\u2019s students, but may reduce your time to degree. The following timeline summarizes the School of Engineering\u2019s expectations for student progress. Please note the academic year runs from fall (late August) through summer (end of July). Yearly Year 1 Click to expand Attend New Graduate Student Orientation and any required trainings (New GTA Training) Begin coursework to complete core requirements: 6-9 credit hours of graduate level courses \u2013 Note you must complete pre-requisite courses before graduate-level courses to be considered in good academic standing (if required) Consult with faculty - select an advisor and a master\u2019s committee 1 and submit your initial Plan of Study for approval online at: School of Engineering Graduation Plan Participate in academic & professional development activities and secure funding for upcoming semesters by midspring Utilize summer research funding or internship opportunities (optional) \u2013 Enrollment in 1-3 research hours over summer (if employed as GRA) Research Students: Start reading relevant literature and developing approaches to your thesis research or project.

Publications make you more marketable and offer leverage over other job applicants Complete Graduation Checklist Requirements 4 and exit interview Graduate Milestones The master\u2019s committee generally consists of at least 3 members. Those members should consist of at least 2 tenured / tenured-track faculty from within the department (including the advisor) and include one additional member who holds any graduate faculty status, including regular, dissertation, or special status. This third member can be, but need not be, a member of the candidate\u2019s department/program. Students may have co-chairs or members from outside KU, but all members must be approved as a regular or special member of the Graduate Faculty (see Master's Oral Exam Committee Composition ). Graduate Students must make satisfactory progress towards their degree to be considered in good standing and eligible for funding as a GTA or GRA. To ensure students are making progress towards their degree, you must submit an annual Graduate Student Activity Report (GAR) to your department prior to the fall semester each academic year. A list of master\u2019s degree requirements can be found at Master's Degree Requirements and within the Academic Catalog . When the master\u2019s candidate has passed the final oral examination or thesis defense and the members of the committee have signed the thesis title and acceptance pages, the student must deliver all graduation requirements to the School of Engineering Research & Graduate Programs Office (1415 LEEP2) so that completion of degree requirements may be officially certified. Some programs have exceptions to the committee composition and examination requirements (coursework only professional degrees). More information can be found at Master's Final Exams & Master's Thesis Submission and Publication . The graduation checklist is available online at Graduate Checklists and graduation deadlines are posted on the KU Graduate Studies webpage at Graduate Studies Graduation (see the annual Academic Calendar under Important Information).",

    "text": "Advising & Mentoring Faculty advisors, particularly for doctoral students, play an important role in students' intellectual development. Every graduate student is expected to work closely with a faculty advisor. Advisors assist students in planning a program of study to meet degree requirements. Students are also encouraged to seek out mentors in addition to their formal faculty advisor, which could include staff, researchers, industry partners and other students. Successful advising and mentoring relationships are characterized by clear expectations, open communication, and a willingness to resolve problems. The resources below can facilitate productive relationships between graduate students and their advisors and mentors. The information below should be used as a general guideline to build a student/advisor relationship. These are not requirements, but rather best practices. Every advisor and lab situation is different, so expectations should be discussed and clearly laid out at the beginning of a student\u2019s career to better understand and meet the goals of the academic program, advisor, and student. If an issue arises with an advisor, each program has a designated Graduate and Undergraduate Director/Advisor who is available to help when needed. Setting Expectations & Resolving Conflicts Student\u2019s should determine their area of interest and understand how they work best in an advising situation before approaching faculty to inquire/interview for a position within a lab or research center. What are your needs in graduate school and reassess those needs regularly as you develop your skills and understanding within academia. Be open and communicate goals and concerns with your advisor and develop a committee that will help you grow and become a strong researcher / industry professional. Each department/program has opportunities for students to learn new skills, but students may also look beyond their program to the school and university for more general skills building (communication, writing, management, networking, career planning). At KU, the quality of our graduate education program depends on the professional and ethical conduct of our campus. Although KU is composed of many individual programs and departments, the faculty, staff and students create a community of intellectuals, each offering significant value to the university. As such, they have similar responsibilities and commitment to upholding academic standards and sustaining a creative and positive community, while serving state and local needs. Focusing on the professional academic relationship between faculty and graduate students, the following guidelines are based on the collective experience and wisdom of many research universities. Their purpose is to serve as a starting point for clear and regular communication about expectations; and to encourage awareness of and commitment to practices that are considered a matter of common sense, courtesy, and basic honesty. Faculty Advisors Serve as a role model and professional mentor to graduate and undergraduate students, staff and junior faculty Help students develop academic, research, writing, oral, quantitative, or other relevant professional skills required by the discipline or field Design programs that take advantage of individual interests and strengths and that can be completed in a timely manner Encouraging, by example, with dedication to high quality teaching (using available resources, such as Human Resources , Office of Institutional Opportunity & Access and Center for Online & Distance Learning ) Encourage faculty-graduate student collaborations which entail the sharing of authorship or rights to intellectual property developed in research or other creative activity Encouraging students to be open about problems in their working relationships (including the relationship with an advisor, committee member, student or staff), and being open to addressing such problems Provide students with an evaluation of their progress and performance in regular and informative ways (suggested frequency is two meetings per semester minimum) and address lack of progress with academic or financial consequences. Help students understand the rules of the institution, including Graduate Studies Policies & Procedures (available in the Policy Library and Graduate Catalog ), or direct them to the staff member who is responsible for this information Help students understand the requirements of the degree program, utilizing the Plan of Study System to ensure timelines and milestones are met and students are meeting their research responsibilities Define research goals verbally and in writing, including research tools, access, security and evaluation, to ensure understanding across cultures and experience levels Discuss laboratory or research authorship policies with students in advance of entering into collaborative projects (utilize resources within the KU Center for Technology Commercialization ) Prepare students to be competitive for employment or future graduate programs by acknowledging student contributions, encouraging participation in academic and research-related conferences, professional publications, and patent applications Encourage students to participate in professional organizations and build on their personal skills and interests that might benefit the student, university or society Maintain professionalism: be respectful and honest in your communication, avoid conflicts of interest, interact with students, staff and faculty colleagues in a professional and civil manner Graduate Studies Understand faculty advisors' central role, as well as their constraints Interact with faculty, staff and other students in a mature, professional, and civil manner in accordance with University policies Recognize that faculty provide education and instruction for the student to conduct research, and, through access to teaching and research funds, may also be able to provide the student with financial support Recognize that the faculty advisor is responsible for monitoring the accuracy, validity, and integrity of a student's research, realizing the quality of that research reflects back on the student, faculty advisor and the University Be aware of time constraints (work hours/holidays/vacation time) and other demands imposed on faculty members and program staff Take the initiative to arrange meetings with the faculty advisor as often as needed or necessary to ensure progress in research and time to degree (minimum: twice a semester) Address problems as early as possible starting with your advisor and then dept/prog director and Assistant; Inform faculty of conflicts and working towards a clear resolution Take responsibility for informing yourself of the regulations, policies, and practices governing financial aid, degree and course requirements, research activities, and conflict resolution (see Graduate Catalog & Student Handbook) and seek clarification from Dean\u2019s Office staff if needed Exercise high professional standards in all aspects your research and studies (observe the University's policy on academic Misconduct) Maintaining absolute integrity in taking examinations and in collecting, analyzing, and presenting research data Take special care to preserve the data collected during experiments or noted during research (with precise identification of sources) in order to avoid future confusion or disputes about access or ownership Acknowledging the contributions of the faculty advisor and other members of the research team to your work in all publications; It is also appropriate to acknowledge the sources of financial support Maintain the confidentiality of the faculty advisor's professional activities and research prior to presentation or publication, in accordance with existing practices and policies of the discipline Understand the requirements of your degree program, utilizing the Plan of Study System to ensure timelines and milestones are met Realize that funding as a GRA or GTA comes with additional responsibilities (on top of your course and research enrollment requirements); Failure to fulfill these requirements can lead to reduced funding or a lower grade Seek additional resources through the university if needed Questions to ask during initial meetings between advisor/student: Research What general area of research is a particular advisor working on and what specific projects are currently being conducted? Is this general area something you are interested in working on for the next few years? Projects are continually evolving. You may not be working on the same project that is currently being conducted. This is often correlated with the aims of grant funding. Who are the lab collaborators\u2026industry, med center, etc??? Where do graduates from the lab find jobs? What conferences do they go to? Have a plan if you are unable to work with your \u201cfirst choice\u201d advisor or project. Peer review and research validation is important. MS students should expect to submit at least one published manuscript and PhD students should submit at least three; though you should discuss individual expectations with your advisor. Know and adhere to all guidelines for intellectual property. When in doubt, ask your advisor. Cohesiveness Find out how much supervision and direction the advisor will give you and in what manner they conduct it. Establish open, effective and straightforward communication with your advisor and other lab personnel. Spend a few weeks in the lab of any prospective advisor before making any decisions. Make sure that the research area and functional dynamics are a good fit. Request to attend group meetings within the lab. Other students in the lab can provide good insight into the project, advisor and expectations. A good relationship with other students is very valuable to your success. Try multiple labs before making a decision. You may be surprised how well you fit into a lab OR research area OR track that you didn\u2019t expect to like. Time Commitments GRA/GTA agreements are typically set at 40-50%. This does NOT mean that you should expect to be in the \u201coffice\u201d for 20 hours per week and you\u2019re done. You should consider your thesis to be above and beyond your GRA/GTA work requirements. An advisor will generally expect you to hold regular hours like a job. Generally between 8-5, you should be working in class, lab, office, etc. Academic breaks are a great opportunity to catch up on research An advisor will expect you to make regular forward progress on your research (even if it is negative results, it\u2019s still progress) The time it takes you to do this will vary. GRA research will develop your knowledge and experience. This should be kept in mind when \u201ccounting the hours you work.\u201d The more work you put in, the more you get out. Outside jobs (on or off campus) are generally frowned upon. Funding It\u2019s important\u2026but not everything! It\u2019s in your best interest to find an advisor that has funding to support you If funds are temporarily not available as a GRA, GTA\u2019s are sometimes available to bridge the gap between a PI\u2019s grants. These should NOT be counted on as a guarantee. Students with a GTA need to consider the time demands by that appointment and the impact that will have on your research ability. You will still be expected to be engaged and productive on your research project. Multiple GTA appointments throughout your career can impede research effectiveness and your graduation timeline. Actively participate in the grant seeking, writing and application process. It is vital to the success of your lab and is extremely beneficial experience for you to have. Funding is tied to a project that has specific aims and deadlines. If you accept funding, you agree to apply your time and efforts to that project. Renewal of financial aid is not automatic. It is contingent upon factors such as availability of funding, satisfactory performance, good academic standing and adequate research progress. Be proactive about your funding. Do some work and find out what options are available to you (ie..NIH, NSF, specific research foundations, etc). Do not expect for your advisor or BIOE administration to keep track of your funding for you. Know when your current funding will end and initiate new funding with enough notice to meet deadlines. General Tips A GRA is \u201ca real job.\u201d Your responsibility is to your advisor and the ongoing research for which he/she is responsible. A GRA does NOT get paid to simply write their thesis or do homework. Even if you are funded through an outside source (SELF, NIH, NSF, etc) you are still responsible for conducting research pertinent to the lab\u2019s goal. Work independently with guidance to solve open-ended problems. Don\u2019t get discouraged when things don\u2019t work the way you expected. If you knew what was going to happen, it wouldn\u2019t be research. Collaborate with your advisor and peers, get creative and try something else. When you graduate and get a job, YOU will be the expert people will turn to for answers. Be able to overcome obstacles in research. It\u2019s good practice to analyze data and make sure it is reasonable as you collect it\u2026.NOT after you\u2019ve conducted all of your experiments or when you are ready to write your thesis. There are some great research opportunities at the medical center and off campus. These come with some additional challenges. It is advisable you discuss these with the program assistant and other students Your advisor\u2019s time is extremely valuable. Consider the value of their time and input and utilize it like you would if you were paying them a consulting fee.

Major: Aerospace Engineering Year: Sophomore Research Faculty Mentor: Dr. Ronald Barrett View full profile More Info:\u00a0Undergraduate Research Fellows Program The most challenging problems in engineering require interdisciplinary approaches. UGR Fellows gain experience and insight into key challenging scientific problems at an early stage in their education. They have a unique opportunity to learn about their area of interest and invent ways to problem solve by advancing projects through conducting experiments. Beyond learning critical interdisciplinary techniques, Fellows learn how to analyze complex experimental results, design their own experiments, and write proposals to apply for undergraduate research grants sponsored by internal and external funding sources. These resources provide UGR Fellows with a unique environment to improve their skills, communicate more effectively at scientific conferences, as well as to potentially get their research published. As UGRF students learn these skills, they likely encounter many obstacles impeding the progress of their projects, but through the mentoring provided, they also learn better problem-solving skills. This experience makes the UGR Fellows more resilient and better scientists and engineers. UGR Fellows are the research ambassadors for Engineering.

Right now, Christian is investigating the utilization of reinforced learning (RL) to create an energy efficient element grouping IRS architecture in wideband channels where the channel state information is not known at the IRS. On receiving the Dean\u2019s First Year Doctoral Fellowship: As a senior undergraduate student, I had my pick from all the universities that I applied to. However, at every other university besides KU, my first year of graduate school would have been doing work other than research. Especially since I was transitioning into a new field of study, I decided that it was of utmost importance to have enough time to focus on my research right away. Ultimately, the Dean's First Year Fellowship brought me to KU, made my transition as smooth as possible, and allowed me to go right into my research, which is exactly what I came here to do. Jacob Hodge Major: Bioengineering (MD/PhD) Faculty Mentor: Dr. Jennifer Robinson and Dr. AJ Mellott Jacob was born and raised in Shawnee, KS. After high-school he attended Kansas State University in Manhattan, KS where he obtained bachelor's degrees in Biology and Biochemistry, a minor in Chemistry, and a Master's in Biochemistry. Ever since he started shadowing local physicians and volunteering as a medical assistant at the community clinic, Jacob has known that he wanted to go to medical school and spend his life trying to help others. As he gained more experience in the medical field, he would find myself wondering how we could better help patients and improve their current standard of care. Jacob has always been curious with figuring out \u201chow\u201d and \u201cwhy\u201d things work the way that they do. It was this inherent instinct that led to him down the path of pursuing biomedical research. Jacob started research in immunomodulatory research as an undergraduate which then evolved into cancer therapeutic research as he transitioned into his Master\u2019s. After graduating from Kansas State University, Jacob spent the next three years working with Dr. Clay Quint, a vascular surgeon at the University of Kansas Medical Center. Dr. Quint's laboratory worked with Bioengineering and Tissue Engineering techniques to develop translational therapies for patients with vascular diseases. After his first year in the lab he was accepted into the M.D.-Ph.D. Physician Scientist Training Program at KUMC and was able to continue his research with Dr. Quint while attending medical school. Jacob\u2019s research consisted of developing a method to tissue engineer vascular grafts by utilizing biopolymers and a technique called electrospinning. They were eventually able to successfully characterize and optimize a tissue engineered vascular graft that was successfully implanted in an animals study. The hope is one day these vascular grafts could be used to implant into patients. After completing the first two years of the medical curriculum and passing his first medical licensing exam, Jacob transitioned into the graduate phase where he has begun working on his dissertation research in order to complete his Ph.D. Jacob is pursuing his Ph.D. in the Department of Bioengineering, where he is co-advised by Drs. AJ Mellott and Jenny Robinson. His research interest revolves around utilizing tissue engineering techniques together with stem cell technologies to develop regenerative therapies in the field of soft tissue and wound care. In his free time, Jacob enjoys cooking, sports, woodworking, and other outdoor activities. Jacob and his wife enjoy their time taking trips and going to sporting events with friends and family. On receiving the Dean\u2019s First Year Doctoral Fellowship: I truly appreciate the opportunity to receive the Dean\u2019s Doctoral Fellowship. It has allotted me a unique opportunity to focus more on my research and training and less on whether I will have funding in the coming months and if I need to spend time searching for other funding sources. By having stable funding and more time for research, I have been able to advance my research which has led to my ability to publish manuscripts and apply for conferences. The dissemination of knowledge is the backbone of scientific discovery and not only is important for me as an individual completing my Ph.D., but it helps the biomedical field as a whole. Lastly, the Dean\u2019s Doctoral Fellowship has served as a stepping-stone for me to apply for future fellowships and grants. Sometimes, getting the first fellowship is the hardest, but from there you can build a strong foundation, which Dean\u2019s Doctoral Fellowship has help do for me, and for that I am forever thankful. Aaron McKinnis Major: Aerospace Engineering Faculty Mentor: Dr. Shawn Keshmiri Aaron McKinnis is a 2nd year PhD student associated with the University of Kansas Aerospace Engineering Department and was a member of the inaugural class of the Dean\u2019s First Year Fellowship. He received his Bachelor\u2019s Degree from KU in the spring of 2019. Since beginning his Ph. D, he has become the flight test lead for the Garrision Flight Research Laboratory. Aaron has been involved in a number of projects funded by NASA, Heising-Simmons, Federal Aviation Administration, and the US Air Force, culminating to over 100 successful flights including multi-agent swarm, collision avoidance, manned-unmanned operation and vertical takeoff and landing. His main area of research is adding a cognitive level to the guidance and control of unmanned systems flying in highly dense population areas, also known as Urban Air Mobility. Aaron is currently working on the design, analysis and manufacturing of the next generation of model and modal sensitive, vertical takeoff and landing aircraft for use by the US Air Force as well as the fitting and instrumentation of an ice penetrating radar on these systems. Additionally, he is concurrently working on the development and flight validation of robust collision avoidance algorithms for use in spatially constrained environments. On receiving the Dean\u2019s First Year Doctoral Fellowship: The Dean\u2019s First Year Fellowship impacted me personally in two large ways. The first and most obvious is that of the financial support. Due to this support, I was able to focus on my first-year coursework and lay a foundation of knowledge that has allowed me to grow into the researcher I am today and lead a team of over a dozen researchers in such a short span. In this time, I was also able to maintain a 4.0 GPA and pass my Doctoral Qualification Exams ahead of schedule. Additionally, with this support, I was able to attend internationally recognized conferences and present my work, further representing myself and the University of Kansas. Secondly, this fellowship brought me into close contact with an interdisciplinary cohort of individuals which otherwise would have been unlikely to meet. Hearing about their research from spanning from advanced prosthetics to watershed characteristics, expanded my horizons. Being near such impressive people also pushed me to conduct more exciting research and forced me to learn how to explain my work to a broader, unknowledgeable group, unlike anything I had presented previously to my peers. Overall, this fellowship was a very positive experience for me and I would like to thank all the sponsors for allowing me to mature into the accomplished student and researcher I am today. Chadwick Sevart Major: Mechanical Engineering Faculty Mentor: Theodore Bergman Chadwick is originally from Wichita, KS and received his bachelor\u2019s degree in mechanical engineering from the University of Kansas. During his junior year, he began working as an undergraduate research assistant with Dr. Theodore Bergman. Chadwick conducted experimental data acquisition on a project involving novel heat sinks to be used in air cooling for thermoelectric generation. Through this work he contributed as second author to a published research paper and realized his passion for research. Chadwick continued working with Dr. Bergman on research involving heat sink design and optimization. In his first year in the Ph. D program at KU he developed an iterative design algorithm for heat sinks cooled by natural convection, which led to a second published paper. Dr. Bergman and Chadwick then adapted the algorithm to include the effects of radiation and recently published a third research paper. On receiving the Dean\u2019s First Year Doctoral Fellowship: The Deans First Year Fellowship has been immensely beneficial to my graduate career. Having a source of funding secured for a year allowed me to focus more on my research and I was able to achieve a lot more than I would have had I not received the fellowship. This progress in my research not only helps for my dissertation but will be a big help in securing future funding. The fellowship also provided personal development opportunities in the monthly meetings which I know will be beneficial to my career outside of graduate school. It was also great to get to know the fellows from other engineering disciplines. Having the opportunity to discuss our research and courses was helpful in the transition between undergraduate and graduate school.",

What are Student/Advisor Expectations Click to expand Student/Advisor Expectations \u2013 A basis to build upon\u2026 The information below should be used as general guidelines in the student/advisor relationship. These are not rules that are set in stone but a platform to build on. Every advisor and lab situation is different so expectations should be discussed and clearly laid out by both parties prior to the \u201ctrack and advisor declaration form\u201d being signed. Things to consider\u2026 Research What general area of research is a particular advisor working on and what specific projects are currently being conducted? Is this general area something you are interested in working on for the next few years? Projects are continually evolving. You may not be working on the same project that is currently being conducted. This is often correlated with the aims of grant funding. Have a plan if you are unable to work with your \u201cfirst choice\u201d advisor or project. Be open-minded about what type of research you might do. You could find a project or area you really love that is completely different than what you thought you wanted to do. Peer review and research validation is important. MS students should expect to submit at least one published manuscript and PhD students should submit at least three; though you should discuss individual expectations with your advisor. Know and adhere to all guidelines for intellectual property. When in doubt, ask your advisor. Cohesiveness Find out how much supervision and direction the advisor will give you and in what manner they conduct it. Establish open, effective and straightforward communication with your advisor and other lab personnel. Spend a few weeks in the lab of any prospective advisor before making any decisions. Make sure that the research area and functional dynamics are a good fit. Request to attend group meetings within the lab. Other students in the lab can provide good insight into the project, advisor and expectations. A good relationship with other students is beneficial to your success. Try multiple labs before making a decision. You may be surprised how well you fit into a lab OR research area OR track that you didn\u2019t expect to like. Time Commitments GRA/GTA agreements are typically set at 40-50%. This does NOT mean that you should expect to be in the \u201coffice\u201d for 20 hours per week and you\u2019re done. You should consider your thesis to be above and beyond your GRA/GTA work requirements. An advisor will generally expect you to hold regular hours like a job. Generally between 8-5, you should be working in class, lab, office, etc. Academic breaks are a great opportunity to catch up on research An advisor will expect you to make regular forward progress on your research (even if it is negative results, it\u2019s still progress) The time it takes you to do this will vary. GRA research will develop your knowledge and experience. This should be kept in mind when \u201ccounting the hours you work.\u201d The more work you put in, the more you get out. Outside jobs (on or off campus) are generally frowned upon. If it is necessary, discuss it with your advisor BEFORE you take another job. Funding It\u2019s important\u2026but not everything! It\u2019s in your best interest to find an advisor that has funding to support you. If funds are temporarily not available as a GRA, GTA\u2019s are sometimes available to bridge the gap between a PI\u2019s grants. These should NOT be counted on as a guarantee. Students with a GTA need to consider the time demands by that appointment and the impact that will have on your research ability. You will still be expected to be engaged and productive on your research project. Multiple GTA appointments throughout your career can impede research effectiveness and your graduation timeline. Actively participate in the grant seeking, writing and application process. It is vital to the success of your lab and is extremely beneficial experience for you to have. Funding is tied to a project that has specific aims and deadlines. If you accept funding, you agree to apply your time and efforts to that project. Renewal of financial aid is not automatic. It is contingent upon factors such as availability of funding, satisfactory performance, good academic standing and adequate research progress. Be proactive about your funding. Do some work and find out what options are available to you (ie..NIH, NSF, specific research foundations, etc). Do not expect for your advisor or BIOE administration to keep track of your funding for you. Know when your current funding will end and initiate new funding with enough notice to meet deadlines. General Tips A GRA is \u201ca real job.\u201d Your responsibility is to your advisor and the ongoing research for which he/she is responsible. A GRA does NOT get paid to simply write their thesis or do homework. Even if you are funded through an outside source (SELF, NIH, NSF, etc) you are still responsible for conducting research pertinent to the lab\u2019s goal. Work independently with guidance to solve open-ended problems. Don\u2019t get discouraged when things don\u2019t work the way you expected. If you knew what was going to happen, it wouldn\u2019t be research. Collaborate with your advisor and peers, get creative and try something else. When you graduate and get a job, YOU will be the expert people will turn to for answers. Be able to overcome obstacles in research. It\u2019s good practice to analyze data and make sure it is reasonable as you collect it\u2026.NOT after you\u2019ve conducted all of your experiments or when you are ready to write your thesis. There are some great research opportunities at the medical center and off campus. These come with some additional challenges. It is advisable you discuss these with the program assistant and other students. Your advisor\u2019s time is extremely valuable. Consider the value of their time and input and utilize it like you would if you were paying them a consulting fee. Questions you should consider asking a prospective advisor\u2026 Do they have specific hours they want to see you in the lab? Is it applicable to do work outside of the lab? Are you allowed to take time off? (vacation, holidays, spring break, summer, etc) How long? Will your project require intervention from others if you\u2019re gone (cultures, etc)? How do they assess your progress? Do you have to initiate contact? Do they have weekly meetings? What should you do if you\u2019re struggling? How is coursework prioritized? What courses should you be taking and how does it apply to both your lab project and thesis? Do they like you to take all courses upfront? Will you be heavily involved in research immediately and taking a light course load every semester? How will this affect your academic timeline? (ie\u2026Qualifying Exam) Can they fund you? Duration and/or terms of agreement? How much? Is tuition included? Other costs included? (fees, travel to conferences, etc.) How can you help apply for more grants? How many journal submissions are expected? How can you be first author of a publication? Where does that lab typically submit publications? Read some current lab publications What conferences are you expected to attend? Will you be submitting abstracts/posters, etc? Is funding assistance available? What are their expectations of you? This is also a great time to share what you expect from them! What is their policy if you deem it necessary to get another job? Outside employment often conflicts with academic/research progress. How will they help you find a job upon graduation? To what areas will your skills make you marketable? Where do their grads get jobs? What is the average and/or expected time to degree for students in that lab? Is their research primarily modeling/computational or experimental? How would your research project be determined? What are the clinical/market applications of the research? With whom do they collaborate? Engineers, industry, med center, etc??? What courses do they teach? How do you change from M.S. to Ph.D. Click to expand A current BioE M.S. candidate may request that the Graduate Studies Committee change his/her status to a Ph.D. aspirant. Before making the request, the student is required to have competed all general and track deficiencies and a minimum of two semesters (Fall and Spring) as a full time KU BioE graduate student with a minimum 3.5 GPA (graduate courses only). The following is required to be submitted to the Graduate Studies Committee: 1) The student\u2019s letter of intent for his/her Ph.D. program of study 2) The advisor\u2019s letter of evaluation on the student\u2019s level of preparation to begin his/her Ph.D. program of study. The committee\u2019s decision will be based on the student\u2019s letter of intent, the advisor\u2019s letter of evaluation, and the student\u2019s academic performance as a KU BioE graduate student. Generally, a student without an undergraduate degree in an engineering discipline will be required to finish the BioE M.S. degree before pursuing the BioE Ph.D. degree. Exception to this policy must be approved by the Graduate Studies Committee.",

BIOE DEGREE REQUIREMENTS Click to expand The M.S. bioengineering degree program provides knowledge breadth in engineering and the biological sciences, and knowledge depth in a particular research area. The degree will prepare students for careers in private and public firms, and a university setting. A thesis is required. The M.S.\u00a0BIOE\u00a0is evidence of an ability to work as an engineer and researcher, who is capable of some independent investigation, and who can present the results of that investigation cogently. The holder of the Master's degree will have completed significant course work, a thesis that describes an independent investigation, and will have passed a final examination on the research underlying the thesis. The program is rigorous, and places high demands on the student. Students must demonstrate that they understand interdisciplinary concepts, are able to generate testable hypotheses, design experiments, and collect and analyze data, both independently and within team and interdisciplinary environments. The degree aspirant works with an advisor from his or her selected track area to develop a formal Plan of Study. The track areas encompass the major research and educational themes within the\u00a0BIOE\u00a0degree program; each track has a director and affiliated faculty. The student selects from among track courses offered under the track areas to construct a comprehensive educational and research program that takes (a) advantage of the student\u2019s background, (b) demonstrates academic and research skills, and (c) capitalizes on the strengths of the affiliated faculty. Goals and Objectives Click to expand The general goals and objectives for the\u00a0BIOE\u00a0Master's degree are to: Provide students with an in-depth understanding of mathematics, engineering principles, physics, chemistry, physiology, and modern biology; train students to apply basic sciences to biological problems, using engineering principles; train students to do bioengineering research; and, train students to apply bioengineering research to commercially viable problems. The Plan of Study Click to expand The student\u2019s Advisor will help the student develop his/her \u201cPlan of Study\u201d, which must be approved by the student\u2019s Advisory Committee. The Plan of Study must consist of the following components: CORE, RESEARCH, DEPTH and BREADTH courses. Details regarding the list of approved courses are available on the Track Advising Sheets.

Click to expand At the University of Kansas, we have three options for undergraduate students interested in Bioengineering and/or Biomedical Engineering: 1. Chemical Engineering with a Biomedical Concentration 2. Mechanical Engineering with a Biomechanics Concentration and 3. 5 year BS Engineering or Computer Science/ MS Bioengineering program The first two of these options allow students to get a degree in one of the traditional engineering disciplines while also exploring bioengineering.\u00a0 The third program allows high achieving students in any engineering discipline or computer science (including those in the Chemical Engineering Biomedical concentration or Mechanical Engineering Biomechanics concentration), to use a fifth year to obtain a master\u2019s degree in Bioengineering on top of an undergraduate degree. About the Program Click to expand Qualified Juniors in the engineering disciplines and computer science at the University of Kansas can apply for an accelerated Master\u2019s in Bioengineering program.\u00a0 Students who are admitted to this program receive academic credit for their exceptional preparation, reducing the time necessary to complete the MS degree. Normally, the MS plan of study requires 24 hours of graduate course credit plus 6 hours of thesis work.\u00a0 Students admitted to the accelerated program receive a 6 credit hour reduction upon admission for 700 level or above course work completed as part of the BS curriculum.\u00a0 This course work should be courses that are required for the MS degree in the bioengineering track of interest within the MS Bioengineering program.\u00a0 Typically this coursework is taken as an advanced engineering elective within the BS curriculum. Application Process Click to expand To take advantage of this accelerated master\u2019s program, undergraduate students at KU would be required to apply to the bioengineering program in the spring semester of their junior year after completing at least 75 credit hours towards their undergraduate degree and at least 15 hours from completion. Graduate applications to start the following summer would open on January 1 and close March 15. The applicants overall GPA and engineering GPA should be at least 3.50 at the time of applying for the program. If accepted, the students must maintain at least a 3.50 for all remaining undergraduate courses in their B.S. program. Students must apply online by the deadline to be considered for this program to ensure an undergraduate course plan is initiated and students are advised appropriately. Application requirements include: Complete Graduate Application (GRE scores are not required for these applicants) Three Letters of Recommendation (one from the student\u2019s identified thesis advisor) A Personal Statement with Proposed Research Topic & Bioengineering Track Focus An Undergraduate Progress Report Form (showing proposed courses up to BS graduation) A Graduate Plan of Study (listing proposed graduate coursework) *Students are required to take all Bioengineering general and track prerequisites as undergraduate electives. This typically means taking a biology and/or chemistry course as a general undergraduate elective (professional elective in EECS, list 2 elective in ME.) Students are highly encouraged to participate in undergraduate research prior to their application in order to identify their research topic and advisor. Students with extenuating circumstances or those who fail to meet the application requirements or deadline, should contact the Bioengineering program. Exceptions will be made on a case by case basis. Student Advising Click to expand This engineering to bioengineering degree option is only available to undergraduate students at KU pursuing an engineering undergraduate degree. Advisors who have students interested in the Bioengineering Accelerated Master\u2019s Program should refer to the Course Plan attached or contact Samantha Foley at samantha.foley@ku.edu or call 785-864-5258. It is important to discuss this option as early as possible, so students do not miss the deadline to apply (in the spring of their junior year). Students will need to be conducting research during the summer and into their senior year and possibly enrolling in extra credit hours (not counted towards their undergraduate BS degree) or co-enrolling as a graduate and undergraduate. \u00a0If co-enrolling is not feasible, other options are available to acquire the necessary classes in the allotted timeframe. Funding Information Click to expand Students should follow all financial aid enrollment and GPA requirements during their undergraduate career. Some instances and sources of financial aid do not allow for co-enrollment and it is the student\u2019s responsibility to contact the necessary resources to make that determination. If this is the case, the student should not enroll in their graduate career until completion of their undergraduate degree in engineering. Their admission can be deferred for up to one year, at which time they should be finished with the undergraduate degree. Once admitted to the Bioengineering Graduate Program, students may apply for funding or financial aid as needed, but the program will not consider these applicants for GTA positions, as their curriculum is accelerated and the work load would be difficult and may prolong their enrollment beyond the one year plan. GRA positions may be available at the discretion of the faculty advisor.",

    "text": "Bioimaging Director: Xinmai Yang, Ph.D. Bioimaging science is an evolving field of biomedicine and bioengineering that involves the development and application of imaging technologies and computational software tools to answer biological questions in life sciences. This discipline brings together engineers, computer scientists, physicists, biologists, chemists and clinicians engaged in the development of equipment and methodologies for characterizing tissue properties and examining its structure and function through in vivo or ex vivo visualization at multiple resolutions, ranging from molecular and cellular to organ level. The imaging technologies are mainly based on the principles of optics, photonics, magnetic resonance, nuclear medicine, radiation, ultrasonics and spectroscopy. Modern applications of bioimaging include multi-photon imaging, image-guided interventional procedures, surgical planning, oncology treatment planning, endoscopic and laparoscopic surgeries and virtual telemedicine. Image processing and analysis is an important part of bioimaging and allows measurement and quantification of anatomical, physiological and/or clinically meaningful parameters. This track is closely linked to the other tracks of the bioengineering program because of supplying critical supportive data. For example, as part of bioimaging, gene-array imaging and analysis provide data for mining with the techniques used in bioinformatics. As the students in this track are prepared for careers in industry, academia and public service, they are trained in the current bioimaging modalities; fundamentals of physical and mathematical principles and operations, hardware and software, image contrast produced and its interpretation, image quality analysis and measures, quality control tests with phantoms, receiver operating characteristics and target detectability, molecular and cellular contrast agents. Students are exposed to in vivo and ex vivo applications and learn biomarkers specific to individual modality and their utilities. Students use this knowledge to interpret the image contrast for understanding the basic anatomical and physiological relationships in normal and abnormal (e.g. disease) states and for accurate and reproducible clinical diagnosis or visualization.

    "text": "Computational Bioengineering Director: Suzanne\u00a0Shontz, Ph.D. Computational Bioengineering generally describes the science of computational approaches to\u00a0biological and medical problems ranging from molecular modeling to healthcare informatics including computational biomechanics and computational bioimaging.\u00a0 Molecular modeling can include biological sequence analysis, the structure and function of proteins and nucleic acids, genetic networks and gene expression, molecular evolution, and hypothesis generation from large-scale data sources.\u00a0 Computational molecular models can be used to inform rational drug design.\u00a0 Healthcare informatics can be used to examine clinical data to better understand disease progression and treatment.\u00a0 Computational methods can also be brought to bear in the understanding of biophysical phenomena such as fluid flow in blood vessels, in the mechanics of cartilage compression, and in the processing of medical images. Central methodologies brought to bear on these problems are derived from probability and statistics, linear algebra, differential equations, optimization, graph theory, algorithms and their analysis, image processing, signal processing, data mining, databases, and linguistics.\u00a0 The computational bioengineering core at KU provides the student with formal course work in methodologies and applications with an emphasis on research.\u00a0 Students in this track are prepared for careers in industry, academia, and public service.\u00a0 They are trained in computer science, mathematical and statistical methods and principles, biological and life sciences, and physical and chemistry principles.\u00a0 While the program is firmly grounded on the techniques of computing, the nature of the research in inherently multidisciplinary.

Faculty and students can design, build, and operate robots and unmanned aircraft in this laboratory, while performing research for the goal of cognitively-inspired intelligent machines. The Cooperative Unmanned Systems Laboratory (CUSL) is a multi-disciplinary research lab at the University of Kansas (KU) that focuses on the design, development, and testing of teams of unmanned systems for cooperative sensing and cooperative control missions. The research objectives of CUSL include autonomous system development, gust/wake sensing and wind soaring using UAVs, design of cooperative sensing and estimation algorithms, and networked cyber-physical systems. The Adaptive Aerostructures Laboratory (AAL) maintains unique capabilities supporting the design, fabrication and testing of aerospace structures with adaptive materials. Unlike conventional materials, adaptive materials change some property as a function of an applied control signal or stimulus. The AAL maintains a range of stocks of piezoelectric, electrostrictive, shape-memory-alloy, magnetostrictive, magnetorheological, and other adaptive materials and processing equipment. In addition to supporting work with adaptive materials, the AAL has generated many aerospace \u201cfirsts\u201d in subscale uninhabited aerial vehicles, morphing aircraft, missiles and munitions. It is currently host to a unique ballistics laboratory where guided bullets and cannon shells are being designed and tested in the 40mm x 10m and 20mm x 5 m gas guns. More than 50 subscale aircraft are housed in the 1200+ sq. feet facility as well as 9 grades of graphite-epoxy composites, 4 grades of Kevlar, composite cure oven, diamond saws and precision post processing machines. In the Computational Thermal Fluids Laboratory we develop state-of-the art CFD algorithms and tools on modern computer platforms such as CPU and GPU clusters. In addition, we apply these tools to solver challenging fluid dynamics problems such as flow over high lift configurations, helicopters, flow inside jet engines, noise generated by moving bodies, to name just a few. Our research has been supported by AFOSR, DOE, NSF, DARPA, ARO, NASA, ONR. The Acoustic Reverberation Suite includes two adjacent, acoustically reverberant (\u201cechoing\u201d) rooms with a 4-foot by 8-foot aperture (\u201cwindow\u201d) between them.\u00a0\u00a0 The suite is designed to measure Transmission Loss (TL) for room or vehicle walls and Absorption Coefficients of sound-absorbing materials used in walls or interior furnishings.\u00a0 Flat or slightly curved panels are inserted into the aperture to measure the TL when sound\u2014generated and measured in the south room\u2014is transmitted to the north room.\u00a0 The difference in the measured sound pressure level (SPL) is resolved as the TL on which the panel Noise Isolation Class (NIC) rating is based.\u00a0 Alternatively, the acoustic absorption of objects placed in one of the rooms may be measured by comparing the room reverberation time with and without the test objects.\u00a0 This facility is currently primarily used to devise and evaluate alternative test methods associated with noise reduction and for testing the noise reduction qualities of panels fabricated with new materials and/or new noise reduction schemes.\u00a0 The types of panels to be evaluated include aircraft fuselage side-walls and new building walls.\u00a0 Coefficients of absorption will be measured for various architectural materials including fabric used for variable reverberation control in auditoriums and similar spaces. M2SEC The Measurement, Materials and Sustainable Environment Center was dedicated in fall 2012. This 47,000 net square-foot building provides a unique opportunity for several engineering and campuswide research groups to work together on projects and to develop commercial applications based on project results. The facility is reserved for research purposes and houses the administrative offices of the KU Transportation Research Institute. The $24 million research building is funded in part through a $12.3 million award from the Department of Commerce\u2019s National Institute of Standards and Technology Construction Grant Program. The School of Engineering, KU and donors to KU Endowment contributed matching funds for the project. Garrison Flight Research Center (Airport Hangar #1) The Garrison Flight Research Center (GFRL) was established in 2004 with the renovation of the existing 18,000 square foot university hangar. The GFRL, now upgraded to 22,000 square feet, has a classroom, machine shop, electronics shop, offices, an AST 4000 fixed base simulator and hangar space for several aircraft. These provide resources for developing intelligent vehicle systems for the flight research of both piloted and uncrewed air vehicles. Additional shop and assembly space, along with a propulsion test cell, are available in an adjacent building, the KUAE \u201cHawkworks\u201d.\u200b The Garrison Flight Research Center houses the department\u2019s Cessna 172 Skyhawk and Cessna 182 RG. The Cessna 172 is used both for transportation and research, while the Cessna 182 is dedicated to flight research activities. The Cessna 182 is specifically configured to accommodate in-flight test instrumentation. Please follow this link to view the University of Kansas Department of Aerospace Engineering Experimental Category Aircraft Policy. AST 4000 Fixed Base Simulator In addition, KUAE has recently invested in an AST 4000 Fixed Base Simulator, produced by American Simulation Technology. This flight simulator is PC based with programmable LCD Instrument Panels and programmable digital aircraft dynamic models. The \u201cvehicle\u201d can accommodate our experimental autopilot module, and offers an out the window projection system and built-in weather and turbulence effects with a programmable control loader. Student designed vehicles may be entered in the flight characteristics module such that vehicles may be \u201cflown\u201d and experienced by the design team. The Structural Load Frame is a 35' x 35' test bed located in the Garrison Flight Research Center hangar at the Lawrence Airport. This test bed is capable of point loads up to 4,000 pounds. Associated with the test floor is a steel frame capable of static testing full-scale aircraft as large as a Raytheon Baron. The frame is also used to conduct acoustic testing on full-scale aircraft fuselage components. The Department of Aerospace Engineering maintains a research machine shop with two milling machines, a lathe, sheet metal break and shear equipment, band saws and drill presses. In addition, the School of Engineering maintains a fully-equipped machine shop with multiple milling machines, surface grinders, vertical and horizontal band saws, drill presses, welding equipment, and a paint booth. New acquisitions include a Stratasys Prodigy fused deposition modeling rapid prototyping center and a computer numerically controlled (CNC) mill with five axes of motion and 48\" x 20\" x 20\" travel in translational axes. Airport Hangar #2 Hangar #2, a 2500 sq ft building at the Lawrence Municipal Airport, houses the Vehicle Manufacturing Facility, the Mal Harned Propulsion Laboratory and the Free Jet Test Stand. The Vehicle Manufacturing Facility includes all the equipment necessary to manufacture and assemble flight vehicles made of aluminum, wood or laminated composites. Equipment for metal-working include a 4-foot wide break, a 4-foot wide shear, 3 riveting stations with a dedicated compressed air supply, and a drill press. Woodworking is enabled by a small band saw, a jig saw and a band sander in a room specially designed to capture airborne wood particles. The reconfigurable workspace of approximately 2500 sq ft is ideal for assembly of aircraft with wing spans up to 40 feet. The Mal Harned Propulsion Laboratory consists of an engine test cell capable of testing gas turbine or reciprocating engines with up to 8,000 pounds of thrust. The control room is equipped with basic engine testing instrumentation. The Free Jet Test Stand is used to conduct experimental research on free jets, plane shear layers, nozzles, diffusers and combustor geometries from low subsonic to supersonic speeds. The high-pressure air supply for this facility is provided by a turbine engine compressor.

    "text": "Eaton Hall Emergency Evacuation Plan 204 - EATON HALL 1520 W. 15th St Lawrence, KS 66045 Emergency Evacuation Plan Prepared by: Amy Mccurdy, Craig Calixte, Danielle Mccarville, Michael Branicky, Victor Frost 4/2/2015 I. PURPOSE AND OBJECTIVES During certain emergency conditions, it may be necessary to evacuate a building. Examples of such occasions include: smoke/fire, gas leak, bomb threat. Pre-planning and rehearsal are effective ways to ensure that building occupants recognize the evacuation alarm and know how to respond. Practicing an evacuation during a non-emergency drill provides training that will be valuable in an emergency situation. Additional information regarding issues such as weather emergencies, bomb threats, etc., can be found on the KU Lawrence Campus Alerts website II. EVACUATING CAMPUS FACILITIES An evacuation may be necessary if there is a power failure, lack of water, hazardous material release, structural damage, bomb threat or other terrorist act, flood, or any other situation that makes the facility unsafe or uninhabitable. An evacuation may be initiated by the fire alarm, by notice from a police or fire official, or by administrative decision. If the fire alarm sounds, or if a Public Safety Officer or fire official gives an evacuation notice, everyone must leave the building. All buildings that are designed for human occupancy are required to have evacuation plans and submit such to the University Emergency Manager Coordinator at kupso@ku.edu within six months of plan implementation to be updated annually by January 1. Department and project administrators are responsible to ensure that all people in their building are aware of exit routes and the location of the building Emergency Assembly Area(s). The Building Emergency Evacuation Plan will be updated and maintained by the Building Emergency Liaison and made available to employees for review. Unless otherwise notified by KU Public Safety or Lawrence Douglas County Fire and Medical personnel, building occupants may briefly delay evacuating if they need time to shut down electrical and other equipment, especially any that involves flame, explosive vapors, or hazardous materials. All building occupants will follow instructions issued by KU Public Safety, Lawrence Douglas County Fire and Medical personnel, and the Building Emergency Liaison. After exiting the building, occupants are to go directly to their designated Emergency Assembly Area(s) and follow guidance provided by KU Public Safety, Lawrence Douglas County Fire and Medical personnel, and the Building Emergency Liaison. The building may not be reentered until authorized KU Public Safety, University Fire Marshal or Lawrence Douglas County Fire and Medical personnel give the \"All Clear\" instruction. Ill. EVACUATION DRILLS Evacuation drills shall be conducted at least once annually at unexpected times and under varying conditions to simulate the unusual conditions that occur should an evacuation be necessary. In accordance with International Fire Code, campus residential facilities are required to have two drills per semester. The Building Emergency Liaison shall schedule evacuation drills with the Emergency Management Coordinator at least four weeks prior to a drill. Individuals with personal action plans and evacuation assistants may request the Building Emergency Liaison to arrange additional drills. The Building Emergency Liaison should provide building name and number, date and time of the drill and any assistance they need to complete the evacuation drill. The Emergency Management Coordinator will notify the KU Public Safety Office, University Fire Marshal and Facilities Services of the evacuation drill. Evacuation drills shall involve all occupants present at the time of drill. Everyone shall leave the building when the fire alarm sounds. It is advisable to notify persons needing special assistance prior to a planned evacuation drill. In the conduct of drills, emphasis shall be placed upon orderly evacuation under proper discipline rather than upon speed.

EMERGENCY REPORTING PROCEDURE If the need for an evacuation is discovered, such as fire: Activate manual fire alarm pull station and exit the building. After exiting the building, Call 9-1-1 and provide further details to emergency personnel. Do not attempt to extinguish the fire unless it is small and you have received training in fire extinguisher operations. Do not place yourself or others in unnecessary danger. Information and training is available through the Environmental Health and Safety Department and through the University Fire Marshal . If you are TRAPPED in the building and cannot find an escape route: Call 9-1-1 and give your exact location. IX.\u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0GENERAL EVACUATION PROCEDURE Immediately obey evacuation alarms and orders to evacuate. Tell others to evacuate. No one may remain inside a building when an evacuation is initiated. (See Section X below for persons needing assistance in an emergency.) Classes in session must evacuate. If involved with hazardous research or doing a dangerous procedure, immediately shut down operations that could create additional hazards if left unattended. Evacuate as soon as possible. Close windows and doors as rooms are vacated. Proceed calmly but quickly to the nearest emergency exit. Use stairways to evacuate, if able to do so. Follow the evacuation route directly to your designated Emergency Assembly Area(s) located at Parking Lot #54 directly South of Eaton Hall. If inclement weather report to the parking garage directly South of Lot #54. Supervisors/managers are responsible for taking roll call. Do not reenter the building until authorized KU Public Safety, University Fire Marshal or Lawrence Douglas County Fire and Medical personnel give the \"All Clear\" instruction. In the event that the building cannot be occupied for an extended period of time, additional direction will be provided by University administration. X. EMERGENCY EVACUATION FOR PERSONS WITH DISABILITIES OR OTHER CONDITIONS University procedures require all people, including those with disabilities or other conditions, to evacuate a facility when the fire alarm is activated or when otherwise instructed to do so. Depending on the facility and the type of disability at issue, a person with a disability or other conditions may have the following evacuation options. Horizontal Evacuation Moving away from the area of imminent danger to a safe distance (i.e., another wing, adjoining building, opposite end of corridor, outside to ground level). Vertical (or Stairway) Evacuation Stairways can be used by those who are able to evacuate with or without assistance. People with visual disabilities may require the assistance of a sighted person. People who must use crutches or other devices such as walking aids will need to use their own discretion, when determining to use stairways, especially where several flights of stairs are concerned. Vertical (Emergency Exit Elevator) Evacuation Elevators designated as \"Emergency Exit Elevators\" approved for use by the University Fire Marshal can be used by people with disabilities or other conditions needing assistance to evacuate. Personal action plans should include a list of buildings with designated \"Emergency Exit Elevators.\" A list of designated \"Emergency Exit Elevators\" is located on the KU Public Safety Office website under Personal Action Plans. A sign adjacent to each landing at any of the Emergency Exit Elevators notifies occupant's availability of elevator. In the event an elevator or \"Emergency Exit Elevator\" is shut down because it is affected by fire, utilize alternate routes designated in your emergency plan, including staying in your office or room and contacting 9-1-1. Moving to an Area of Refuge or Rescue Assistance Area(s) or Refuge Some buildings on campus have been designed to have Area of Refuge or Rescue Assistance Area(s) or Refuge(s) which includes communication devices to a monitored location. Refer to the Building's Emergency Floor Plans located at each exit to determine whether or not the building has an Area of Refuge(s) or Rescue Assistance Area(s) or Refuge(s) and, if so, the location(s). The following buildings have Area of Refuge or Rescue Assistance Area or Refuge locations: Building Location Other Instructions Murphy Hall South wing only See evacuation floor plan Strong Hall All (3) three enclosed stairs. Not Applicable Memorial Stadium Press box Not Applicable Allen Fieldhouse South elevator only Not Applicable Malott Hall Designated stairwells See evacuation floor plan These areas are identified to rescue personnel as likely areas for individuals to locate in the event they are unable to evacuate a building. People needing evacuation assistance should familiarize themselves with these locations. Additional information about the locations of these areas may be obtained by contacting the facility's Building Emergency Liaison or the Office of Design and Construction Management. Use of Elevator No elevator should be used unless it is an EXIT ELEVATOR. Staying in Place Individuals with disabilities or other conditions which do not allow them to evacuate with others, should include in their personal action plan the specific location of their \"Stay in Place\" (i.e., office, resident hall room, classrooms). Remain in a room with an exterior window and a telephone. Close the door, if possible. Individuals staying in place should CALL 9-1-1, if this hasn't been done already. The dispatcher will assist by notifying on-scene emergency personnel of the location of a person with disability or other condition who needs evacuation assistance. If the telephone lines fail, the individual can signal when possible from the window by waving a cloth or other visible object. It is the responsibility of every member of the University community to immediately communicate to emergency personnel the location of individuals who are unable to evacuate. Individuals using the \"Stay in Place\" option must provide their location in their personal action plan. Alert Systems The University recommends that all University faculty, students, and employees, including people with disabilities and other conditions, register with the KU text message alert system to receive KU Alert text message. Please note that the actual fire alert is not part of this text messaging system.",

Examples of such occasions include: smoke/fire, gas leak, bomb threat. Pre-planning and rehearsal are effective ways to ensure that building occupants recognize the evacuation alarm and know how to respond. Practicing an evacuation during a non-emergency drill provides training that will be valuable in an emergency situation. Additional information regarding issues such as weather emergencies, bomb threats, etc., can be found on the KU Lawrence Campus Alerts website: KU Lawrence Campus Alerts website II.EVACUATING CAMPUS FACILITIES An evacuation may be necessary if there is a power failure, lack of water, hazardous material release, structural damage, bomb threat or other terrorist act, flood, or any other situation that makes the facility unsafe or uninhabitable. An evacuation may be initiated by the fire alarm, by notice from a police or fire official, or by administrative decision. If the fire alarm sounds, or if a Public Safety Officer or tire official gives an evacuation notice, everyone must leave the building. All buildings that are designed for human occupancy are required to have evacuation plans and submit such to the University Emergency Manager Coordinator at kupso@ku.edu within six months of plan implementation to be updated annually by January 1. Department and project administrators are responsible to ensure that all people in their building are aware of exit routes and the location of the building Emergency Assembly Area(s). The Building Emergency Evacuation Plan will be updated and maintained by the Building Emergency Liaison and made available to employees for review. Unless otherwise notified by KU Public Safety or Lawrence Douglas County Fire and Medical personnel, building occupants may briefly delay evacuating if they need time to shut down electrical and other equipment, especially any that involves flame, explosive vapors, or hazardous materials. All building occupants will follow instructions issued by KU Public Safety, Lawrence Douglas County Fire and Medical personnel, and the Building Emergency Liaison. After exiting the building, occupants are to go directly to their designated Emergency Assembly Area(s) and follow guidance provided by KU Public Safety, Lawrence Douglas County Fire and Medical personnel, and the Building Emergency Liaison. The building may not be reentered until authorized KU Public Safety, University Fire Marshal or Lawrence Douglas County Fire and Medical personnel give the \"All Clear\" instruction. Ill. EVACUATION DRILLS Evacuation drills shall be conducted at least once annually at unexpected times and under varying conditions to simulate the unusual conditions that occur should an evacuation be necessary. In accordance with International Fire Code, campus residential facilities are required to have two drills per semester. The Building Emergency Liaison shall schedule evacuation drills with the Emergency Management Coordinator at least four weeks prior to a drill. Individuals with personal action plans and evacuation assistants may request the Building Emergency Liaison to arrange additional drills. The Building Emergency Liaison should provide building name and number, date and time of the drill and any assistance they need to complete the evacuation drill. The Emergency Management Coordinator will notify the KU Public Safety Office, University Fire Marshal and Facilities Services of the evacuation drill. Evacuation drills shall involve all occupants present at the time of drill. Everyone shall leave the building when the fire alarm sounds. It is advisable to notify persons needing special assistance prior to a planned evacuation drill. In the conduct of drills, emphasis shall be placed upon orderly evacuation under proper discipline rather than upon speed. The Building Emergency Liaison is expected to perform the assigned duties as if in an actual emergency situation. The Secondary and Tertiary Building Emergency Liaison's and Building Advisory Committee members may assist in the drill. Provisions should be made for timing and evaluating orderliness of each drill.

After exiting the building, Call 9-1-1 and provide further details to emergency personnel. Do not attempt to extinguish the fire unless it is small and you have received training in fire extinguisher operations. Do not place yourself or others in unnecessary danger. Information and training is available through the Environmental Health and Safety Department and through the University Fire Marshal . If you are TRAPPED in the building and cannot find an escape route: Call 9-1-1 and give your exact location. IX.\u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0GENERAL EVACUATION PROCEDURE Immediately obey evacuation alarms and orders to evacuate. Tell others to evacuate. No one may remain inside a building when an evacuation is initiated. (See Section X below for persons needing assistance in an emergency.) Classes in session must evacuate. If involved with hazardous research or doing a dangerous procedure, immediately shut down operations that could create additional hazards if left unattended. Evacuate as soon as possible. Close windows and doors as rooms are vacated. Proceed calmly but quickly to the nearest emergency exit. Use stairways to evacuate, if able to do so. Follow the evacuation route directly to your designated Emergency Assembly Area(s) located at If exiting through Eaton Hall, report to Lot #54 directly South of Eaton Hall. If inclement weather, report to the parking garage directly South of Lot #54. If exiting the West end of Learned report to parking Lot #41. If exiting to the North or East of Learned report to the grassy area (North), or Lot #33 (East). Supervisors/managers are responsible for taking roll call. Do not reenter the building until authorized KU Public Safety, University Fire Marshal or Lawrence Douglas County Fire and Medical personnel give the \"All Clear\" instruction. In the event that the building cannot be occupied for an extended period of time, additional direction will be provided by University administration. X.EMERGENCY EVACUATION FOR PERSONS WITH DISABILITIES OR OTHER CONDITIONS University procedures require all people, including those with disabilities or other conditions, to evacuate a facility when the fire alarm is activated or when otherwise instructed to do so. Depending on the facility and the type of disability at issue, a person with a disability or other conditions may have the following evacuation options. Horizontal Evacuation Moving away from the area of imminent danger to a safe distance (i.e., another wing, adjoining building, opposite end of corridor, outside to ground level). Vertical (or Stairway) Evacuation Stairways can be used by those who are able to evacuate with or without assistance. People with visual disabilities may require the assistance of a sighted person. People who must use crutches or other devices such as walking aids will need to use their own discretion, when determining to use stairways, especially where several flights of stairs are concerned. Vertical (Emergency Exit Elevator) Evacuation Elevators designated as \"Emergency Exit Elevators\" approved for use by the University Fire Marshal can be used by people with disabilities or other conditions needing assistance to evacuate. Personal action plans should include a list of buildings with designated \"Emergency Exit Elevators.\" A list of designated \"Emergency Exit Elevators\" is located on the KU Public Safety Office website under Personal Action Plans. A sign adjacent to each landing at any of the Emergency Exit Elevators notifies occupant's availability of elevator. In the event an elevator or \"Emergency Exit Elevator\" is shut down because it is affected by fire, utilize alternate routes designated in your emergency plan, including staying in your office or room and contacting 9-1-1. Moving to an Area of Refuge or Rescue Assistance Area(s) or Refuge Some buildings on campus have been designed to have Area of Refuge or Rescue Assistance Area(s) or Refuge(s) which includes communication devices to a monitored location. Refer to the Building's Emergency Floor Plans located at each exit to determine whether or not the building has an Area of Refuge(s) or Rescue Assistance Area(s) or Refuge(s) and, if so, the location(s). The following buildings have Area of Refuge or Rescue Assistance Area or Refuge locations: Building Location Other Instructions Murphy Hall South wing only See evacuation floor plan Strong Hall All (3) three enclosed stairs. Not Applicable Memorial Stadium Press box Not Applicable Allen Fieldhouse South elevator only Not Applicable Malott Hall Designated stairwells See evacuation floor plan These areas are identified to rescue personnel as likely areas for individuals to locate in the event they are unable to evacuate a building. People needing evacuation assistance should familiarize themselves with these locations. Additional information about the locations of these areas may be obtained by contacting the facility's Building Emergency Liaison or the Office of Design and Construction Management. Use of Elevator No elevator should be used unless it is an EXIT ELEVATOR. Staying in Place Individuals with disabilities or other conditions which do not allow them to evacuate with others, should include in their personal action plan the specific location of their \"Stay in Place\" (i.e., office, resident hall room, classrooms). Remain in a room with an exterior window and a telephone. Close the door, if possible. Individuals staying in place should CALL 9-1-1, if this hasn't been done already. The dispatcher will assist by notifying on-scene emergency personnel of the location of a person with disability or other condition who needs evacuation assistance. If the telephone lines fail, the individual can signal when possible from the window by waving a cloth or other visible object. It is the responsibility of every member of the University community to immediately communicate to emergency personnel the location of individuals who are unable to evacuate. Individuals using the \"Stay in Place\" option must provide their location in their personal action plan. Alert Systems The University recommends that all University faculty, students, and employees, including people with disabilities and other conditions, register with the KU text message alert system shtml to receive KU Alert text message. Please note that the actual fire alert is not part of this text messaging system.",

    "text": "Contact Visiting Us The Bioengineering Graduate Program staff is happy to work with all prospective students in determining the fit between the student and the Program. In order to determine this, we feel that visiting our campus in Lawrence and the Medical Center campus in Kansas City is a very important step. In order to facilitate your visit to KU, there are two main options: The first, and most preferred, option entails simply applying for Fall admission to the program. If you are admitted, it is highly likely that you will be invited to participate in BIOE Sneak Peek in late February prior to the Fall semester of your intended matriculation. A portion of the costs for your travel, accommodations and meals will be reimbursed to you if you participate in Visitation Days. This organized visitation opportunity will allow you time to gather a great deal of first-hand information which we hope will help you in making a final decision about whether KU is the best fit for you. The second option is making arrangements to visit us on your own, outside of organized events. With early notification, we will do our best to work with you to provide information and schedule appointments with faculty when possible. Please contact us if you feel that this is the best option for you. Please contact the Bioengineering Program Coordinator, bioe@ku.edu or 785-864-5258 , to schedule a visit or with questions about the application process.

Additionally, the Test of Spoken English (TSE) may be required. Please see KU English Proficiency Requirements for more details. What are Student/Advisor Expectations Click to expand Student/Advisor Expectations \u2013 A basis to build upon\u2026 The information below should be used as general guidelines in the student/advisor relationship. These are not rules that are set in stone but a platform to build on. Every advisor and lab situation is different so expectations should be discussed and clearly laid out by both parties prior to the \u201ctrack and advisor declaration form\u201d being signed. Things to consider\u2026 Research What general area of research is a particular advisor working on and what specific projects are currently being conducted? Is this general area something you are interested in working on for the next few years? Projects are continually evolving. You may not be working on the same project that is currently being conducted. This is often correlated with the aims of grant funding. Have a plan if you are unable to work with your \u201cfirst choice\u201d advisor or project. Be open-minded about what type of research you might do. You could find a project or area you really love that is completely different than what you thought you wanted to do. Peer review and research validation is important. MS students should expect to submit at least one published manuscript and PhD students should submit at least three; though you should discuss individual expectations with your advisor. Know and adhere to all guidelines for intellectual property. When in doubt, ask your advisor. Cohesiveness Find out how much supervision and direction the advisor will give you and in what manner they conduct it. Establish open, effective and straightforward communication with your advisor and other lab personnel. Spend a few weeks in the lab of any prospective advisor before making any decisions. Make sure that the research area and functional dynamics are a good fit. Request to attend group meetings within the lab. Other students in the lab can provide good insight into the project, advisor and expectations. A good relationship with other students is beneficial to your success. Try multiple labs before making a decision. You may be surprised how well you fit into a lab OR research area OR track that you didn\u2019t expect to like. Time Commitments GRA/GTA agreements are typically set at 40-50%. This does NOT mean that you should expect to be in the \u201coffice\u201d for 20 hours per week and you\u2019re done. You should consider your thesis to be above and beyond your GRA/GTA work requirements. An advisor will generally expect you to hold regular hours like a job. Generally between 8-5, you should be working in class, lab, office, etc. Academic breaks are a great opportunity to catch up on research An advisor will expect you to make regular forward progress on your research (even if it is negative results, it\u2019s still progress) The time it takes you to do this will vary. GRA research will develop your knowledge and experience. This should be kept in mind when \u201ccounting the hours you work.\u201d The more work you put in, the more you get out. Outside jobs (on or off campus) are generally frowned upon. If it is necessary, discuss it with your advisor BEFORE you take another job. Funding It\u2019s important\u2026but not everything! It\u2019s in your best interest to find an advisor that has funding to support you. If funds are temporarily not available as a GRA, GTA\u2019s are sometimes available to bridge the gap between a PI\u2019s grants. These should NOT be counted on as a guarantee. Students with a GTA need to consider the time demands by that appointment and the impact that will have on your research ability. You will still be expected to be engaged and productive on your research project. Multiple GTA appointments throughout your career can impede research effectiveness and your graduation timeline. Actively participate in the grant seeking, writing and application process. It is vital to the success of your lab and is extremely beneficial experience for you to have. Funding is tied to a project that has specific aims and deadlines. If you accept funding, you agree to apply your time and efforts to that project. Renewal of financial aid is not automatic. It is contingent upon factors such as availability of funding, satisfactory performance, good academic standing and adequate research progress. Be proactive about your funding. Do some work and find out what options are available to you (ie..NIH, NSF, specific research foundations, etc). Do not expect for your advisor or BIOE administration to keep track of your funding for you. Know when your current funding will end and initiate new funding with enough notice to meet deadlines. General Tips A GRA is \u201ca real job.\u201d Your responsibility is to your advisor and the ongoing research for which he/she is responsible. A GRA does NOT get paid to simply write their thesis or do homework. Even if you are funded through an outside source (SELF, NIH, NSF, etc) you are still responsible for conducting research pertinent to the lab\u2019s goal. Work independently with guidance to solve open-ended problems. Don\u2019t get discouraged when things don\u2019t work the way you expected. If you knew what was going to happen, it wouldn\u2019t be research. Collaborate with your advisor and peers, get creative and try something else. When you graduate and get a job, YOU will be the expert people will turn to for answers. Be able to overcome obstacles in research. It\u2019s good practice to analyze data and make sure it is reasonable as you collect it\u2026.NOT after you\u2019ve conducted all of your experiments or when you are ready to write your thesis. There are some great research opportunities at the medical center and off campus. These come with some additional challenges. It is advisable you discuss these with the program assistant and other students. Your advisor\u2019s time is extremely valuable. Consider the value of their time and input and utilize it like you would if you were paying them a consulting fee. Questions you should consider asking a prospective advisor\u2026 Do they have specific hours they want to see you in the lab? Is it applicable to do work outside of the lab? Are you allowed to take time off? (vacation, holidays, spring break, summer, etc) How long? Will your project require intervention from others if you\u2019re gone (cultures, etc)? How do they assess your progress? Do you have to initiate contact? Do they have weekly meetings? What should you do if you\u2019re struggling? How is coursework prioritized? What courses should you be taking and how does it apply to both your lab project and thesis? Do they like you to take all courses upfront? Will you be heavily involved in research immediately and taking a light course load every semester? How will this affect your academic timeline? (ie\u2026Qualifying Exam) Can they fund you? Duration and/or terms of agreement? How much? Is tuition included? Other costs included? (fees, travel to conferences, etc.) How can you help apply for more grants? How many journal submissions are expected? How can you be first author of a publication? Where does that lab typically submit publications? Read some current lab publications What conferences are you expected to attend? Will you be submitting abstracts/posters, etc? Is funding assistance available? What are their expectations of you? This is also a great time to share what you expect from them! What is their policy if you deem it necessary to get another job? Outside employment often conflicts with academic/research progress. How will they help you find a job upon graduation? To what areas will your skills make you marketable? Where do their grads get jobs? What is the average and/or expected time to degree for students in that lab? Is their research primarily modeling/computational or experimental? How would your research project be determined? What are the clinical/market applications of the research? With whom do they collaborate? Engineers, industry, med center, etc??? What courses do they teach? How do you change from M.S. to Ph.D. Click to expand A current BioE M.S. candidate may request that the Graduate Studies Committee change his/her status to a Ph.D. aspirant. Before making the request, the student is required to have competed all general and track deficiencies and a minimum of two semesters (Fall and Spring) as a full time KU BioE graduate student with a minimum 3.5 GPA (graduate courses only). The following is required to be submitted to the Graduate Studies Committee: 1) The student\u2019s letter of intent for his/her Ph.D. program of study 2) The advisor\u2019s letter of evaluation on the student\u2019s level of preparation to begin his/her Ph.D. program of study. The committee\u2019s decision will be based on the student\u2019s letter of intent, the advisor\u2019s letter of evaluation, and the student\u2019s academic performance as a KU BioE graduate student. Generally, a student without an undergraduate degree in an engineering discipline will be required to finish the BioE M.S. degree before pursuing the BioE Ph.D. degree. Exception to this policy must be approved by the Graduate Studies Committee.",

    "text": "M.S. Masters Degree M.S. BIOE DEGREE REQUIREMENTS Click to expand The M.S. bioengineering degree program provides knowledge breadth in engineering and the biological sciences, and knowledge depth in a particular research area. The degree will prepare students for careers in private and public firms, and a university setting. A thesis is required. The M.S.\u00a0BIOE\u00a0is evidence of an ability to work as an engineer and researcher, who is capable of some independent investigation, and who can present the results of that investigation cogently. The holder of the Master's degree will have completed significant course work, a thesis that describes an independent investigation, and will have passed a final examination on the research underlying the thesis. The program is rigorous, and places high demands on the student. Students must demonstrate that they understand interdisciplinary concepts, are able to generate testable hypotheses, design experiments, and collect and analyze data, both independently and within team and interdisciplinary environments. The degree aspirant works with an advisor from his or her selected track area to develop a formal Plan of Study. The track areas encompass the major research and educational themes within the\u00a0BIOE\u00a0degree program; each track has a director and affiliated faculty. The student selects from among track courses offered under the track areas to construct a comprehensive educational and research program that takes (a) advantage of the student\u2019s background, (b) demonstrates academic and research skills, and (c) capitalizes on the strengths of the affiliated faculty. Goals and Objectives Click to expand The general goals and objectives for the\u00a0BIOE\u00a0Master's degree are to: Provide students with an in-depth understanding of mathematics, engineering principles, physics, chemistry, physiology, and modern biology; train students to apply basic sciences to biological problems, using engineering principles; train students to do bioengineering research; and, train students to apply bioengineering research to commercially viable problems. The Plan of Study Click to expand The student\u2019s Advisor will help the student develop his/her \u201cPlan of Study\u201d, which must be approved by the student\u2019s Advisory Committee. The Plan of Study must consist of the following components: CORE, RESEARCH, DEPTH and BREADTH courses. Details regarding the list of approved courses are available on the Track Advising Sheets.

    "text": "Accelerated M.S. Accelerated M.S. What does Bioengineering at KU look like for undergraduates? Click to expand At the University of Kansas, we have three options for undergraduate students interested in Bioengineering and/or Biomedical Engineering: 1. Chemical Engineering with a Biomedical Concentration 2. Mechanical Engineering with a Biomechanics Concentration and 3. 5 year BS Engineering or Computer Science/ MS Bioengineering program The first two of these options allow students to get a degree in one of the traditional engineering disciplines while also exploring bioengineering.\u00a0 The third program allows high achieving students in any engineering discipline or computer science (including those in the Chemical Engineering Biomedical concentration or Mechanical Engineering Biomechanics concentration), to use a fifth year to obtain a master\u2019s degree in Bioengineering on top of an undergraduate degree. About the Program Click to expand Qualified Juniors in the engineering disciplines and computer science at the University of Kansas can apply for an accelerated Master\u2019s in Bioengineering program.\u00a0 Students who are admitted to this program receive academic credit for their exceptional preparation, reducing the time necessary to complete the MS degree. Normally, the MS plan of study requires 24 hours of graduate course credit plus 6 hours of thesis work.\u00a0 Students admitted to the accelerated program receive a 6 credit hour reduction upon admission for 700 level or above course work completed as part of the BS curriculum.\u00a0 This course work should be courses that are required for the MS degree in the bioengineering track of interest within the MS Bioengineering program.\u00a0 Typically this coursework is taken as an advanced engineering elective within the BS curriculum. Application Process Click to expand To take advantage of this accelerated master\u2019s program, undergraduate students at KU would be required to apply to the bioengineering program in the spring semester of their junior year after completing at least 75 credit hours towards their undergraduate degree and at least 15 hours from completion. Graduate applications to start the following summer would open on January 1 and close March 15. The applicants overall GPA and engineering GPA should be at least 3.50 at the time of applying for the program. If accepted, the students must maintain at least a 3.50 for all remaining undergraduate courses in their B.S. program. Students must apply online by the deadline to be considered for this program to ensure an undergraduate course plan is initiated and students are advised appropriately. Application requirements include: Complete Graduate Application (GRE scores are not required for these applicants) Three Letters of Recommendation (one from the student\u2019s identified thesis advisor) A Personal Statement with Proposed Research Topic & Bioengineering Track Focus An Undergraduate Progress Report Form (showing proposed courses up to BS graduation) A Graduate Plan of Study (listing proposed graduate coursework) *Students are required to take all Bioengineering general and track prerequisites as undergraduate electives. This typically means taking a biology and/or chemistry course as a general undergraduate elective (professional elective in EECS, list 2 elective in ME.) Students are highly encouraged to participate in undergraduate research prior to their application in order to identify their research topic and advisor. Students with extenuating circumstances or those who fail to meet the application requirements or deadline, should contact the Bioengineering program. Exceptions will be made on a case by case basis. Student Advising Click to expand This engineering to bioengineering degree option is only available to undergraduate students at KU pursuing an engineering undergraduate degree. Advisors who have students interested in the Bioengineering Accelerated Master\u2019s Program should refer to the Course Plan attached or contact Samantha Foley at samantha.foley@ku.edu or call 785-864-5258. It is important to discuss this option as early as possible, so students do not miss the deadline to apply (in the spring of their junior year). Students will need to be conducting research during the summer and into their senior year and possibly enrolling in extra credit hours (not counted towards their undergraduate BS degree) or co-enrolling as a graduate and undergraduate. \u00a0If co-enrolling is not feasible, other options are available to acquire the necessary classes in the allotted timeframe. Funding Information Click to expand Students should follow all financial aid enrollment and GPA requirements during their undergraduate career. Some instances and sources of financial aid do not allow for co-enrollment and it is the student\u2019s responsibility to contact the necessary resources to make that determination. If this is the case, the student should not enroll in their graduate career until completion of their undergraduate degree in engineering. Their admission can be deferred for up to one year, at which time they should be finished with the undergraduate degree. Once admitted to the Bioengineering Graduate Program, students may apply for funding or financial aid as needed, but the program will not consider these applicants for GTA positions, as their curriculum is accelerated and the work load would be difficult and may prolong their enrollment beyond the one year plan. GRA positions may be available at the discretion of the faculty advisor.",

    "text": "Master of Engineering M.Eng. Bioengineering Degree Requirements Overview Click to expand The University of Kansas (KU) Master of Engineering in Bioengineering degree program is a coursework only master\u2019s degree. It is very similar to the Master of Science in Bioengineering degree at the University of Kansas. The primary difference is the elimination of research, the thesis and the thesis defense. The thesis credit hours are replaced with the same credit hours of coursework. This degree will prepare students to be more effective in their careers in medicine, private commercial firms, and with entrepreneurship in a start-up company. The coursework-only Master of Engineering in Bioengineering degree is an efficient way for baccalaureate graduates to get more in-depth background and credentials in bioengineering prior to seeking employment. The program is rigorous, and places high demands on the student who must demonstrate that they understand interdisciplinary concepts. The Master of Engineering in Bioengineering degree program provides knowledge breadth in engineering and the biological sciences, and knowledge depth in a particular focused area of coursework. Applicants for the Master of Engineering in Bioengineering will have a baccalaureate degree in engineering, biological science, or a related field. Successful applicants will have strong academic credentials and demonstrated potential for advanced study by performance at the baccalaureate level. The completed Master of Engineering in Bioengineering is evidence of an ability to work as an engineer who is capable of advanced analysis and design. The holder of this degree will have completed significant course work to advance their knowledge and abilities in the area of bioengineering. Master of Engineering students will choose an area of focus from the Bioengineering track list to determine their coursework requirements. Bioimaging Computational bioengineering Biomaterials and tissue engineering Biomechanics and neural engineering Biomedical product design and development Biomolecular engineering The individual track requirements can be found on the Bioengineering website .

Degree Requirements Click to expand The Master\u2019s aspirant works with an advisor familiar with their selected track area to develop a formal plan of study. The tracks are focused in major research and educational themes within the Bioengineering Graduate Program; each track has a track director and affiliated faculty. The student selects from among track courses to construct a comprehensive educational program that takes (a) advantage of the student\u2019s background, (b) builds and demonstrates academic skills, and (c) capitalizes on the strengths of the affiliated faculty. This approach follows a structure common to many of the top Bioengineering/Biomedical Engineering graduate programs nationally (Table 1).

    "text": "Bioimaging Director: Xinmai Yang, Ph.D. Bioimaging science is an evolving field of biomedicine and bioengineering that involves the development and application of imaging technologies and computational software tools to answer biological questions in life sciences. This discipline brings together engineers, computer scientists, physicists, biologists, chemists and clinicians engaged in the development of equipment and methodologies for characterizing tissue properties and examining its structure and function through in vivo or ex vivo visualization at multiple resolutions, ranging from molecular and cellular to organ level. The imaging technologies are mainly based on the principles of optics, photonics, magnetic resonance, nuclear medicine, radiation, ultrasonics and spectroscopy. Modern applications of bioimaging include multi-photon imaging, image-guided interventional procedures, surgical planning, oncology treatment planning, endoscopic and laparoscopic surgeries and virtual telemedicine. Image processing and analysis is an important part of bioimaging and allows measurement and quantification of anatomical, physiological and/or clinically meaningful parameters. This track is closely linked to the other tracks of the bioengineering program because of supplying critical supportive data. For example, as part of bioimaging, gene-array imaging and analysis provide data for mining with the techniques used in bioinformatics. As the students in this track are prepared for careers in industry, academia and public service, they are trained in the current bioimaging modalities; fundamentals of physical and mathematical principles and operations, hardware and software, image contrast produced and its interpretation, image quality analysis and measures, quality control tests with phantoms, receiver operating characteristics and target detectability, molecular and cellular contrast agents. Students are exposed to in vivo and ex vivo applications and learn biomarkers specific to individual modality and their utilities. Students use this knowledge to interpret the image contrast for understanding the basic anatomical and physiological relationships in normal and abnormal (e.g. disease) states and for accurate and reproducible clinical diagnosis or visualization.
